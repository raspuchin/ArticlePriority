Sara then said she would see if he was fun and has a sense of humour. Kareena was surprised that good looks was not on the list.Not really. Im not one of those. Im okay without that. It will probably be better because then they wouldnt be self-obsessed, which is something I cant handle, Sara said.Kareena looked at her in disbelief, so Sara added, I mean, he doesnt have to be bad-looking, but he doesnt have to be so good-looking that thats all we talk about.

       " 'Chinese researchers investigating the animal origin of the coronavirus outbreak in China have said that the endangered pangolin may be the missing link between bats and humans.Bats are known carriers of the latest strain of the disease, which has infected at least 31,000 people and killed more than 630 worldwide, mostly in China where the outbreak started.A genetic analysis showed that the strain of the virus currently spreading among humans was 96% identical to that found in bats.But according to Arnaud Fontanet, from Frances Pasteur Institute, the disease did not jump straight from bats to humans. We think theres another animal thats an intermediary, he told AFP.The Sars outbreak of 2002-3, involving a different strain of coronavirus, was transferred to humans by the civet, a small mammal whose meat is considered a delicacy in China.Many animals are capable of transmitting viruses to other species, and nearly all strains of coronavirus contagious to humans originated in wildlife.Several studies have shown that the bat-borne virus lacks the necessary hardware to latch onto human cell receptors. But its still not clear which animal is the missing link.Fontanet believes the intermediary was probably a mammal, possibly belonging to the badger family.After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists at the South China Agricultural University found that the genome sequences of viruses in pangolins to be 99% identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported.But other experts urged caution. This is not scientific evidence, said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge. Investigations into animal reservoirs are extremely important, but results must be then be published for international scrutiny.Simply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99% is not sufficient, he added.To conclusively identify the culprit, researchers would need to test each species that was on sale at the market  a near impossibility given that it is now permanently closed.Martine Peeters, a virologist at Frances Institute for Research and Development (IRD), was part of the team that identified the host animal of the Ebola virus during recent epidemics.They found that it was indeed a bat that passed the virus on to humans, and Peeters believes that is likely to be the case this time around. During her Ebola research, we collected thousands of bat dropping from several sites in Africa, Peeters told AFP.Fontanet said that the Chinese are carrying out research now.They say theyve analysed samples from a rubbish truck, he said. They dont say which, but I think its likely to have been excrement that was just lying around.While it may be too late for this outbreak, identifying the carrier animal for the novel coronavirus could prove vital in preventing future flare-ups.China, for example, outlawed the sale of civet for food during the Sars epidemic.Eric Leroy, a virologist and vet at the IRD said that the search could well turn up a result quickly, as with Sars. Equally, it could take years. With Ebola, research started in 1976 and we didnt see the first results published until 2005, he told AFP.One determining factor could be what percentage of the same species are infected. If thats low, less than 1% for example, thats obviously going to lower the chance you stumble upon an infected animal, said Leroy.For Fontanet, coronavirus is just the latest example of the potentially disastrous consequence of humans consuming virus-carrying wild animals. He said that China needed to take pretty radical measures against the sale of wild animals in markets.Beijing has prohibited the practice, but only moved to do so last month, when the outbreak was already out of control.Each time, we try to put out the fire, and once its out we await the next one, said Franois Renaud, a researcher at the Paris-based National Centre for Scientific Research.He recommended compiling a watch list of all animals that could potentially transmit viruses to humans. You need to see epidemics before they come, and therefore you need to be proactive, he said.',\n",

The balance amount will be given as grant to the district collectorate, according to officials.The decision on extending the scheme to other parts of the state would be dependent upon the response.These canteens will function at places where poor persons work or live like at markets, district hospitals, bus stations, railway stations and government offices.Initially, 50 Shiv Bhojan outlets will be set up for people where full meals will be available at Rs 10. We will expand the number of such outlets phase-wise depending on feedback, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had told the Legislative Assembly. ',\n",

       " 'Doctors have been using a robot to treat the first person known to have been admitted to hospital in the US with a new strain of the coronavirus, as part of an effort to prevent the spread of the disease, which has killed at least 17 people in China and infected hundreds more.The man in his 30s was admitted to the special pathogens unit in a hospital in Everett, Washington, on Monday. The US citizen had recently returned from a trip to central China and had been diagnosed in Seattle.Dr George Diaz, the section chief of infectious diseases at Providence Regional Medical Center Everett, told the Guardian the patient was in a satisfactory condition on Wednesday. He did not give an update on how long the patient would remain in the unit.Diaz said he had sat outside a window of the patients 20ft x 20ft room to operate the robot, which was equipped with a camera, microphone and stethoscope. It is one of many ways the hospital has worked to reduce risk of the virus spreading.Diaz said the patient was picked up from his home and taken to the hospital by ambulance. He was brought to the isolation unit in an Isopod  a closed gurney and then allowed to move around inside his room once it was secured.The virus is thought to have originated around Wuhan, in Hubei province, where more than 540 people have been hospitalized. The World Health Organization has been considering declaring the growing viral pneumonia outbreak in China to be a public health emergency of international concern.Symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing have also been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Most of those confirmed to have died of the illness had previous medical conditions and were 60 or older, and all were located in China.CDC officials have said the risk to the American public is low.According to Diaz, this is the first time the Everett medical center has admitted a patient into its special pathogens unit. The hospital and its staff have been preparing for the possibility since 2015, when the hospital created the unit in response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa.Every few weeks [were] doing drills and training like you would for an earthquake or fire drill or something like that, and so youre always trying to maintain a state of readiness, he said. The wheels were greased enough that it wasnt hard to get the process rolling to activate all the procedures that we had put in place.The hospital has two rooms in the unit, but its working on plans to prepare at least 10 additional rooms, should there be a need.The hospital is part of a large health system made up of dozens of hospitals and hundreds of clinics and urgent care centers in seven states. Since admitting the patient in Washington state, all of these facilities have activated a screening tool for the virus.Now when someone, for example, wants to go to an ER, the first thing that the person on the other end will ask is have you traveled to China in the past 14 days or been close to someone whos traveled to China in the past 14 days, said Diaz.There is only one entry point for the special pathogens unit, which is guarded by security officers, said Diaz. Visitors wear a special type of helmet called a CAPR, as well full body protection.Washingtons governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement on Tuesday that health departments at the local and state levels were prepared for this type of situation, and should there be other cases in the US, the state will continue to work to share information and help however we can.',\n",
       " 'JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel on Sunday announced that it would permit Israeli citizens to travel to Saudi Arabia for the first time, under certain conditions that include Israeli entrepreneurs seeking  investments, in a signal of warming ties. Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, after consulting the countrys security establishment, issued a statement saying that Israelis would be allowed to travel to Saudi Arabia under two circumstances: for religious reasons on pilgrimage on the haj, or for up to nine days for business reasons such as investment or meetings.  Travelers would still need an invitation and permission from the Saudi authorities, the statement said.    Israel has peace treaties with two Arab countries  Egypt and Jordan  but concerns over Irans influence in the region have led to thawing ties with some Gulf states as well. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been looking to capitalize on common interests like Iran while also marketing  Israeli technologies to try and further normalize relations. Israelis  mostly Muslims going on pilgrimage  have been traveling to Saudi Arabia for years but usually with special permission or using foreign passports. Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saudi Arabia launched a new tourism visa last year for visitors from 49 countries as part of its bid to diversify the economy and open up society. Israel is not one of the eligible countries. However, in 2018 Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for a commercial flight to Israel with the start of a new Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv, although national carrier El Al Israel Airlines may not use Saudi airspace for eastward flights.

       " 'Donald Trump demanded the dismissal of Marie Yovanovitch, then US ambassador to Ukraine and now a key figure in the presidents impeachment trial, according to a video recording released to the media.The footage was reportedly taken during an April 2018 donor dinner at a hotel and released to news media by an attorney for Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Trumps personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.Parnas and his business partner Igor Fruman are key players in Trumps alleged campaign to pressure the government of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, a potential election opponent for the president.The issue is central to Trumps ongoing impeachment trial in the US Senate.The existence of the tape was first reported by ABC News on Friday.Trumps order to fire the ambassador came after Parnas told him that Yovanovitch was an impediment, and claimed that she had privately disparaged the president.Get rid of her! Trump says on the tape, reportedly addressing a White House aide at the dining table.Get her out tomorrow. I dont care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.In a July 2019 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to mount an investigation of his potential rival for the White House in the 2020 election,Joe Biden, and son Hunter Biden  and also to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, instead of Russia, was behindforeigntamperingin the 2016 election.Trump framed the requests as a favor after he reminded his counterpart that the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine. Overshadowing the conversation was the fact that Trump had recently suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia .News of the callemergedin a Washington Post report on 18 September that an internal whistleblower complaint, filed in August, involved communications between Trump and a foreign leader.Trumps attempted dealings in Ukraine caused a scandal in US diplomatic ranks. The Democrats have obtainedtext messagesbetween top US envoys in Ukraine establishing that diplomatstold Zelenskiy that a White House visit to meet Trump was dependent on him making a public statement vowing to investigate Hunter Bidens company.Trump does not dispute public accounts of what he said in the call, as established by the whistleblowerscomplaint, released on 26 September, and a callsummaryreleased by the White House itself.But Trump and allies have argued that the conversation  Ive given you that, now I need this  was not actually as transactional as it appears to be.Trumps personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has pressured Ukraine to smear Biden, and the whistleblower said White House officials had caused records of Trumps Ukraine call to be moved into a specially restricted computer system. Thevice-president, Mike Pence, has acknowledged contacts with Ukrainian officials while claiming to have no knowledge of Trumps Biden agenda.On 3 October 2019, Trump evensuggestedthat: China should start an investigation into the Bidens.Unlike when he was a candidate, Trumps invitations for foreign powers to attack his domestic political opponents now have all the power of the White House behind them. Critics say this is a plain abuse of that power and it undermines US national security because it places Trumps personal agenda first.The Trump administration also stands accused of obstruction of Congress for resisting congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony relating to the crisis.A lot of people  from the whistleblower, to career government officials swept up in the affair, to legal scholars, to Democrats and even some Republicans believe its plausible that the president has committed animpeachable offense.Tom McCarthyin New YorkImages taken at an awkward angle appear at the start of a video lasting an hour and 23 minutes. The rest of the recording shows a tan background, as if the camera were covered, but Trumps distinctive voice is clear.In a TV interview with MSNBC News last week, Parnas said Trump knew exactly what was going on with his and Frumans efforts to pressure Ukrainian authorities to investigate Biden.His appearance came after Democrats released documents that showed Giuliani worked with Parnas to pressure Kyiv to investigate Biden.Both Parnas and Fruman were charged with violating US campaign finance laws in October.The documents also showed the pair, working with Ukrainian officials, trying to force out Yovanovitch, a respected career diplomat who Trump eventually removed in May 2019.The recording released to the US media on Saturday corroborates much of what Parnas said in his TV interview, including that he knew Trump  something the president has denied.In November Yovanovitch testified to Congress that she was recalled due to unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.Joseph Bondy, an attorney for Parnas, said he submitted the evidence to investigators in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.He also told CNN that Parnas had more recordings and photographs that might be released to the public.The release of the tape increases the pressure on US senators to subpoena witnesses for the impeachment trial, a move several polls show has strong support among the US public.White House lawyers began Trumps defence in the impeachment trial on Saturday.They have argued that the president did nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine and that US voters  not Congress  should decide his fate.Trumps lawyers will resume his defence on Monday.',\n",
       " 'At least one person was wounded when three rockets hit the US embassy in Baghdad on Sunday, a senior Iraqi official told AFP on condition of anonymity. One of the rockets hit an embassy cafeteria at dinner time, a security source told AFP, while two others landed nearby. The US embassy did not respond to requests for comment and it was not immediately clear whether the injured person was an American national or an Iraqi staff member working at the mission. The attack marked a dangerous escalation in the spree of rocket attacks in recent months that have targeted the embassy or Iraqi military bases where American troops are deployed. None of the attacks has been claimed but Washington has repeatedly blamed Iran-backed military factions in Iraq. On Sunday, one rocket hit an embassy cafeteria at dinner time while two others landed nearby, a security source told AFP.A senior Iraqi official told AFP at least one person was wounded, but it was not immediately clear how serious the injuries were and whether the person was an American national or an Iraqi staff member working at the mission. The attack took place earlier in the day than usual, with AFP reporters hearing the booms on the western bank of the river Tigris at precisely 7:30 pm (1630 GMT). Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and Speaker of Parliament Mohammed Halbusi both condemned the incident, saying it risked dragging their homeland into war.Iraq has already been dragged into a worrying tit-for-tat between the United States and Iran over the last month. A similar attack on a northern Iraqi base killed an American contractor, and the US retaliated with a strike on an Iran-backed faction known as Kataeb Hezbollah. Less than a week later, a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi military figure Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside the Baghdad airport -- prompting Iran to fire ballistic missiles at an Iraqi base where US troops are stationed. - Only for you, Iraq! -Some 5,200 Americans are stationed in Iraq to lead the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, but the US strike on Baghdad has rallied top Iraqi figures around a joint call to order them out.Vehemently anti-American cleric Moqtada Sadr organised a mass rally in Baghdad on Friday, where thousands of his supporters called for American troops to leave. Sadr had previously backed separate anti-regime protests sweeping Iraqs capital and south, even though he controls the largest bloc in parliament and top ministerial posts.Bolstered by his own protest on Friday, Sadr announced he was dropping support for the youth-dominated reform campaign rocking the country since October. His followers, widely regarded as the best-organised and well-stocked of the anti-government demonstrators, immediately began dismantling their tents and heading home.Activists feared that without his political cover, authorities would move to crush their movement -- and indeed, within hours, riot police tried to storm protest camps across the capital and south. Those efforts continued into Sunday, with security forces using live rounds and tear gas to try to flush protesters out of squares and streets they had occupied for months.One protester was shot dead in Baghdad and another in the flashpoint southern city of Nasiriyah, medical sources said, and dozens more were wounded across the country.In the capital, riot police have tried to clear streets around the main protest camp of Tahrir Square but have yet to enter the symbolic area, where many protesters stood their ground even after tents there were dismantled.Just after midnight in Nasiriyah, unknown assailants stormed the main protest camp in Habbubi Square and set the tents on fire, the flames lighting up the night sky, an AFP correspondent there said. - UN hails Iraqi hopes -Despite the renewed violence, thousands of students flooded the streets in the capital and across the south in a bid to keep national attention focused on their demands.Only for you, Iraq! read a sign held by a young protester in the shrine city of Karbala, hinting at the movements insistence on not being affiliated with any political party or outside backer. In Basra, hundreds of students gathered to condemn the riot polices dismantling of their main protest camp the previous day, according to an AFP correspondent.The youth-led protests erupted on October 1 in outrage over lack of jobs, poor services and rampant corruption before spiralling into calls for a government overhaul after they were met with violence.More than 470 people have died, a vast majority of them demonstrators, since the rallies erupted.Protesters are now demanding snap elections, the appointment of an independent premier and the prosecution of anyone implicated in corruption or recent bloodshed.Their voices have been heard by top UN envoy in Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert who has said: Unaccountability and indecisiveness are unworthy of Iraqi hopes, courageously expressed for four months now.While death and injury tolls continue to rise, steps taken so far will remain hollow if not completed, she said Saturday.',\n",
       " 'KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan forces used ground attacks and air strikes in multiple operations against the Taliban during the last 24 hours, killing 51 fighters in an escalation that signaled renewed deadlock in peace talks. Afghanistans Defense Ministry said on Sunday that government forces had conducted 13 ground offensives and 12 air strikes in nine provinces, adding that 51 terrorists had been killed, 13 wounded and six arrested. Local officials in the northern province of Balkh said at least three women and four children were killed in the air strikes, prompting protests in front of the provincial governors office. The government pledged to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the reports of civilian deaths. Meanwhile, the Taliban said it had staged two more attacks targeting security forces over the weekend, following sporadic assaults last week. Afghan security forces checkpoints in Kunduz were attacked on Saturday night, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement, adding that 10 members of the security forces were killed and three wounded. Taliban fighters also captured a large weapons cache, he said. In a separate statement, the Taliban said its fighters had ambushed an Afghan forces patrol in Balkh, killing eight security personnel. The spike in hostilities comes as U.S. and Taliban negotiators in Doha take a two-day break for consultations about how to overcome recent hurdles in the talks, a source close to the process told Reuters. Negotiations between the two sides began last year in Doha but have been interrupted at least twice after Taliban attacks on U.S. military personnel in September and December. Last week, another round of talks kicked off with U.S. Special Representative on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad meeting repeatedly with the Talibans chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Multiple sources close to the talks said the Taliban had agreed internally to halt attacks against U.S. forces and reduce assaults against Afghan government interests.  Over the last week, however, reports of attacks by Taliban fighters on government installations, including police stations continued to filter in from different parts of Afghanistan.

       " 'China remains the centre of the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus, with cases and deaths heavily concentrated in Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan. Cases have been reported in other countries around the world as health authorities scramble to prevent a pandemic.Authorities in China have placed at least 20 cities on lockdown as they battle to contain the spread. Travel restrictions have been imposed in cities across Hubei province where the outbreak originated. Wholesale closure of transport infrastructure has taken place across the region, affecting the movement of at least 36 million people. Infections have been confirmed in almost all of Chinas provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin.The outbreak is centred on the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and home to more than 11 million people. Efforts have begun to build a 1,000-bed hospital in a matter of days to relieve pressure on existing Wuhan medical facilities that have been overwhelmed with patients. There have also been reports of empty supermarket shelves and barricades going up.Wuhans international airport serves 104 destinations including 29 outside China. There are three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Heathrow, where arrivals from the affected city will now enter through a separate area. Screening has started at the three US airports where Wuhan flights land. Checks are also in place at airports in the other east Asian countries that have confirmed the virus is present.France has identified three cases. Authorities say two of the three infected people belong to the same family. One of the patients, a 48-year-old man, passed through Wuhan. He was in contact with about 10 people before he was taken into care.In Australia, three patients in New South Wales and one in Victoria have been diagnosed with the virus.Malaysia confirmed its first three cases on Saturday. All are Chinese nationals on holiday from Wuhan who arrived in the country from Singapore two days earlier.Canada said it discovered its first case, a man is his 50s who recently flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou and then on to Toronto.US health officials have announced three positive tests.Japans health authorities in Japan  a destination for many lunar new year holidaymakers  confirmed a second case on Friday. Singapore has announced at least four cases: A 66-year-old man and his 37-year-old son, who arrived in Singapore on Monday from Wuhan, a 52-year-old Wuhan woman, who arrived in the city-state on Tuesday, and a 36-year-old man from Wuhan who sought treatment on 24 January and was immediately isolated.Elsewhere, South Koreas government confirmed its third case, while two cases have been confirmed in Vietnam. Thailands public health ministry has confirmed five cases. Taiwan has reported three cases and Macao two.The Wuhan coronavirus is mainly spread through the respiratory tract. A seafood market selling wild animals in Wuhan is the suspected source of the virus. Scientists believe it probably jumped from an animal to a human and is now transmissible from one person to another, and could mutate further.Comparisons have been drawn with the Sars outbreak in 2003, which was similarly caused by a coronavirus. Chinas handling of Sars was criticised because it played down the first cases. The virus spread to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting almost 8,500 people and killing almost 1,000.',\n",

It cannot be that you become a superstar, you are getting all the attention and people dont react if they dont like something about you. They will react and you have to take it positively. Thats the only way But of course, we are humans. Celebrities do get affected, he said.Talking about how he was affected by the trolling, Himesh said, In 2006, when they called me nasal Every song of mine was a blockbuster, I had 50 blockbusters I just got a little angry. He opened up about the time he tried to defend himself by saying that even legendary composer-singer RD Burman sang nasally, which led to his wife and legendary singer Asha Bhosle saying that he deserves to be slapped for his comments, and his subsequent apology.Himesh added that criticism must be taken in ones stride.

Because then, she will give the world to you. The problem is when anything challenges your intelligence and then you want to prove that you are right. How can my wife always be right? Tell me, in 10-12 years, Sonia is always right! And she believes that she is always right. I have to say that she is always right, and then, everything is right. Eventually, because I love her like crazy, I have to accept it. It is better that I accept it in one go and dont get into a debate. Just kill my intelligence, even if it is challenging me.

Iranian Foreign Minister says Iran wants to negotiate with The United States, but wants sanctions removed. @FoxNews @OANN No Thanks! Trump tweeted in English on Saturday and later in Farsi.  Irans Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded on Sunday by tweeting an excerpt from the interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, where he said Iran is still open to negotiations with America if sanctions are lifted.  @realdonaldtrump is better advised to base his foreign policy comments & decisions on facts, rather than @FoxNews headlines or his Farsi translators, Zarif said in the tweet with the interview excerpt.  Tensions between Iran and the United States have reached the highest levels in decades after the U.S. killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to fire missiles days later at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops are stationed. Tensions between the two have been increasing steadily since Trump pulled the United States out of Irans nuclear pact with world powers in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have driven down Irans oil exports and hammered its economy.

       " 'The aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first public appearance in about six years, state media reported Sunday, quelling rumors that she was purged or executed by her nephew. According to a Korean Central News Agency dispatch, the name of Kim Kyong Hui was included in a list of top North Korean officials who watched a performance marking Lunar New Years Day with Kim Jong Un at a Pyongyang theater on Saturday. North Koreas main newspaper also released a photo showing Kim Kyong Hui sitting near Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, at the Samjiyon Theater. Kim Kyong Hui, 73, was once an influential figure in North Korea as the only sister of late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un. She held a slew of top posts such as a four-star army general and a ruling Workers Party departmental director. She was also believed to have played a key role in grooming Kim Jong Un as the next leader after Kim Jong Il suffered a stroke in 2008. Kim Jong Un eventually inherited power after his father died of a heart attack in late 2011. Kim Kyong Huis fate had been in doubt after Kim Jong Un had her husband, Jang Song Thaek, executed for treason in December 2013. He was once considered the Norths No. 2. Days after Jangs execution, Kim Kyong Huis name was mentioned in a KCNA dispatch as a member of a funeral committee for another top official. But she missed a state ceremony commemorating the second anniversary of Kim Jong Ils death days later. Her name had since never been mentioned in North Korean state media until Sundays KCNA report. Some North Korea monitoring groups in Seoul and foreign media outlets had speculated Kim Jong Un had his aunt also executed or purged, or she died of health problems. Outside experts said Kim Kyong Hui had long suffered from liver and heart problems and high blood pressure. Analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at South Koreas private Sejong Institute said Kim Kyong Huis reemergence suggested Kim Jong Un was attempting to strengthen a unity of his ruling family as hes pushing to harden his position toward the United States in stalled nuclear negotiations. Cheong, however, predicted that Kim Kyong Hui wont likely regain her political influence as she has no position in the Norths powerful Politburo, whose memberships have already been filled with new figures.

       " 'Two decades after Americas milk carton kids faded into folklore, a Florida brewery has revived the tradition for animals in need of help: printing photographs on its beer cans of dogs seeking a new home.Managers at Bradentons Motorworks craft brewery hope that the idea will catch on in the same way that publicizing missing childrens photographs on milk carton did in the 1980s and 90s, before the practice was overtaken by digital technology.Already two dogs have been adopted from Manatee countys animal services department as a result, the brewery selling more than 150 four-packs of Kolsch featuring photos of the four dogs as a yappy hour event last weekend.We are huge animal lovers here, huge dog people, Barry Elwonger, Motorworks director of sales and marketing, told Florida TV station WFLA.Two dogs from the original batch, Morton and King, were adopted this week while the others, Candy and Day Day, are still in the countys shelter in Palmetto, awaiting adoption along with 150 other animals.Theres hundreds more dogs that are looking for their homes. We wanted to showcase [that] the shelter has some really wonderful dogs, Elwonger said.The tradition of printing photographs of missing children on milk cartons became popular in the 1980s, prompted by the disappearance of a six-year-old-boy, Etan Patz, in New York in 1979. Patz was never found but a New Jersey grocery store clerk was convicted of his murder two years ago.The practice had faded by the turn of the century, supplanted by technology including the nationwide Amber Alert system that sends information immediately to mobile phones.',\n",
       " 'MUMBAI :Not all mall owners in Mumbai are rushing to the idea of opening 24/7 due to concerns over additional costs, manpower and doubts over footfalls late night. Many though term the Maharashtra government\\'s move as progressive.Last week, the Maharashtra cabinet approved its \\'Mumbai 24 hour policy\\' allowing malls, shops and restaurants in the city to open 24 hours and seven days week, if they wish to, from 27 January. \"We are hopeful that this move will provide jobs and revenue to our youth,\" Aditya Thackeray, tourism and environment minister in the state government had told reporters.Several mall owners said they are yet to decide on whether they would keep their malls open all night. Few others plan to initially extend their food courts and eateries by a few more hours than usual, especially during the weekends, to gauge the footfalls and demand during wee hours.At present, shops are allowed to open till 10 pm while restaurants can remain open till 1.30 am latest. The new regulation does not apply to pubs and bars which are required to shut by 1.30 am.\"We haven\\'t decided to open 24/7 as of now. What we are doing right now is rolling out the food and beverages first. Our food courts will be open until 3 a.m. but only during the weekends. It is easier to get people to eat rather than shopping,\" said Mukesh Kumar, chief executive officer, Infiniti Mall.A subsidiary of real estate company K Raheja Constructions, Infiniti Mall operates two malls at Andheri and Malad in Mumbai suburbs.Kumar said it is too early to expect that the move would help improve consumption in the near future. \"It\\'s a complete change in habit. You don\\'t start shopping next day from 12\\'o clock at night... And Mumbai is not really a big tourist centre. Though there are domestic tourists, there are not many international tourists. There will be some change but not immediately. It will take time, \" Kumar said.A spokesperson of Mumbai\\'s leading mall Oberoi Mall declined to comment on the development.According to Shubranshu Pani, managing director (retail services), JLL India, while retailers are delighted that it provides them opportunity to keep their shops open by few more hours, malls are not yet ready to remain open 24/7.\"Retailers are anyway struggling to get footfalls during the day and weekends. And the cost of operation of shopping centres in the evening every single hour is significantly high. You are targeting a fractional crowd but you have to keep all the services long,\" Pani said.Such moves to open shops and eating joints would work only in high streets, highly populated areas, pass through places or places where there are call centres, he added.Rajneesh Mahajan, chief operating officer (CEO), Inorbit Malls Pvt Ltd, said the company is yet to make a decision if their malls would remain open 24/7.\"We are still talking to retailers trying to understand what their views are on the additional working hours. It may take some to understand and get prepared. It is difficult to say whether we will be able to do it immediately because it takes a lot of preparation, manpower and look into other additional costs involved. New hiring has to happen to make it work, \" Mahajan said.He is doubtful if retailers have the ability to run 24 hours or attract consumers beyond certain time. \"Unless there are larger offers on table consumers wouldn\\'t find it interesting. We have not arrived at a decision right now, \" he said.Last week the Retailers Association of India (RAI) had welcome the state government\\'s decision to allow shops, malls and restaurants to open 24/7.Kumar Rajagopalan, chief executive officer, Retailers Association of India (RAI) said the move will help retailers achieve better sales as well as increase revenue collection for the state government. \"More importantly, it will increase employment. Our expectation is that employment in the retail sector will increase by as much as 10% in the next three years, \" Rajagopalan said.',\n",

       " 'BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Residents of Chinas Hubei province, where the new coronavirus outbreak was first reported, will be banned from entering Hong Kong from Monday as China tries to halt the rapid spread of the outbreak. Chinas Cabinet also announced it will extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 and schools will return from their break later than usual, state broadcaster CCTV said. Health authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic of the virus, which has infected more than 2,000 people in China and killed 56. A handful of cases of infection have been reported in other countries, including Thailand, Australia, the United States,  France and Canada. No fatalities have been recorded outside China.   The mayor of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei province and at epicenter of the outbreak, said he expected another 1,000 new patients in the city, which was stepping up construction of special hospitals. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. Chinas National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur. The Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally celebrated by hundreds of millions of Chinese traveling around the country and abroad to see family, began on Friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak. Ma said China would intensify its containment efforts, which have so far included transport and travel curbs and cancellation of big events. The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. Alibabas Taobao online marketplace said it has removed sales of face masks from shops that show unstable prices or false advertising, as prices for the products surged. The World Health Organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was on his way to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has six confirmed cases, will also ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, the citys government said. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents. Hubeis governor, Wang Xiaodong, said on Sunday he felt agonized and responsible for the outbreak. He described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight. China confirmed 2,051 cases of infection as of 7 p.m. (1100 GMT) on Jan. 26, while the death toll from the virus remained at 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts. Health officials in Orange County, California, said a third case had been registered in the United States in a traveler from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.  On Sunday, China temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and often poached animals packed together in Chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans. The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent. The U.S. State Department said it will relocate personnel at its Wuhan consulate to the United States, while Japan was working with China to arrange a charter flight for Japanese nationals to return from Wuhan. Around 50 Italians in Wuhan and the Hubei region were offered transport out. The outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown and  transport links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles. Health authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning. Beijing also postponed the reopening of the citys schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, state radio reported. Hong Kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to Feb. 17. China has called for transparency in managing the crisis,  after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of  SARS, a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. But officials in Wuhan have been criticized for their handling of the current outbreak. People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities, said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located. Illustrating the extent of disruption to life in China, overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29% on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42%, a transportation ministry official said. Many cinemas across China were closed and cruise ship operators canceled some sailings that had been due to leave Chinese ports. In Hong Kong, Disneyland and Ocean Park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily over the holiday, has already closed.

We salute their collective cry for upholding the principles of the Constitution of India, with its promise of a plural and diverse society. We are aware that we have not always lived up to that promise, and many of us have too often remained silent in the face of injustice. The gravity of this moment demands that each of us stand for our principles.The policies and actions of the present government, passed quickly through parliament and without opportunity for public dissent or open discussion, are antithetical to the principle of a secular, inclusive nation. The soul of the nation is threatened. The livelihoods and statehoods of millions of our fellow Indians are at stake. Under the NRC, anyone unable to produce documentation (which, in many cases, does not exist) to prove their ancestry may be rendered stateless. Those deemedillegal through the NRC may be eligible for citizenship under the CAA, unless they are Muslim.Contrary to the stated objective of the government, this does not appear to be a benign legislation, only meant to shelter persecuted minorities. The list of exclusions seems to indicate otherwise. Why are minorities from other neighbours like Sri Lanka, China and Myanmar excluded? Isit because the ruling powers in these latter countries are not Muslim? It appears that the legislation believes that only Muslim governments can be perpetrators of religious persecution. Why exclude the most persecuted minorities in the region,the Rohingya of Myanmar or the Uighurs of China? This legislation only acknowledges Muslim perpetrators, never Muslim victims. The aim is transparent: Muslims are the unwelcome Other.This is state-sanctioned religious persecution, and we will not condone it. In Assam and the Northeast, and in Kashmir, the indigenous identity and livelihood is threatened as never before, and we will not condone it. The response of the government and law-enforcement agencies to the distress of its citizens has been callous and high-handed. India has seen the most Internet shutdowns of any democracy in the world. Police brutality has left hundreds injured, including many students from Jamia Milia Islamia University and Aligarh Muslim University. Several citizens have been killed while protesting. Many more have been placed in preventive detention. Section 144 has been imposed in numerous states to curb protests. We need look no further than Kashmir to see how far this government is willing to go to suppress democratic dissent. Kashmir is now living under the longest Internet shutdown ever imposed by a democratic government. Enough is enough.Those of us who have been quiet in the past, our silence ends now. We will be clear-sighted in our dissent. Like our freedom fighters before us, we stand for a secular and inclusive vision of India.

       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - Smartphones and other devices sold in Russia must be pre-installed with software that is morally sound and espouses traditional Russian values, according to new draft rules. President Vladimir Putin signed legislation last year requiring all smartphones, computers and smart TV sets sold in the country to come pre-installed with Russian software.  The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service has now drafted guidelines outlining what kinds of software could be made mandatory. A draft government resolution seen by Reuters said such software should help with the formation of the priority of traditional Russian spiritual and moral values. It must be both popular and secure. The text did not explicitly define these values, and the monopoly office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During his two decades in power, Putin has closely aligned himself with the Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, as seen for example in attitudes towards homosexuality and gender fluidity. The liberal idea has become obsolete, he said in an interview with the Financial Times last year. The draft rules say software and apps can be put forward for consideration by private companies, state entities or the central bank. They are due to be finalised by the end of the month, then discussed with market players and submitted to the government for adoption in March.  Supporters of the software requirement hope it will help Russian IT firms vie with foreign competitors. But the legislation was opposed by Russian electronics retailers who said it had been passed without them being consulted.      Russia has introduced tougher internet laws in recent years, requiring search engines to delete some search results, messaging services to share encryption keys with security services, and social networks to store user data on servers in the country.

       " 'The results are finally in for the first chocolate chip cookie bake-off in space.While looking more or less normal, the best cookies required two hours of baking time last month up at the International Space Station. It takes far less time on Earth, under 20 minutes.And how do they taste? No one knows. Still sealed in individual baking pouches and packed in their spaceflight container, the cookies remain frozen in a Houston-area lab after splashing down two weeks ago in a SpaceX capsule. They were the first food baked in space from raw ingredients.The makers of the oven expected a difference in baking time in space, but not that big.Theres still a lot to look into to figure out really whats driving that difference, but definitely a cool result, Mary Murphy, a manager for Texas-based Nanoracks, said this week. Overall, I think its a pretty awesome first experiment.Located near Nasas Johnson Space Center, Nanoracks designed and built the small electric test oven that was launched to the space station last November. Five frozen raw cookies were already up there.Luca Parmitano, an Italian astronaut, was the master baker in December, radioing down a description as he baked them one by one in the prototype Zero G oven.The first cookie  in the oven for 25 minutes at 300F (149C)  ended up seriously under-baked. He more than doubled the baking time for the next two, and the results were still so-so.The fourth cookie stayed in the oven for two hours, and finally: success.So this time, I do see some browning, Parmitano radioed. I cant tell you whether its cooked all the way or not, but it certainly doesnt look like cookie dough any more.Parmitano cranked the oven up to its maximum 325F (163C) for the fifth cookie and baked it for 130 minutes. He reported more success.Additional testing is required to determine whether the three returned cookies are safe to eat.As for aroma, the astronauts could smell the cookies when they removed them from the oven, except for the first.Thats the beauty of baking in space, according to Mike Massimino, a former Nasa astronaut. He now teaches at Columbia University and is a paid spokesman for DoubleTree by Hilton. The hotel chain provided the cookie dough, the same kind used for cookies offered to hotel guests. Its offering one of the space-baked cookies to the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum for display.The reminder of home, the connection with home, I think, cant be overstated, Massimino said. From my personal experience ... food is pretty important for not just nutrition but also for morale in keeping people connected to their home and their Earth.Eating something other than dehydrated or prepackaged food will be particularly important as astronauts head back to the moon and on to Mars.Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen, a New York City startup that collaborated with the experiment, are considering more experiments for the orbiting oven and possibly more space appliances. Whats in orbit now are essentially food warmers.Theres an added bonus of having freshly baked cookies in space.We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year, Nasa astronaut Christina Koch tweeted.

       " 'Delta Air Lines is being fined $50,000 for ordering three Muslim passengers off planes even after the airline\\'s own security officials cleared them to travel.Delta denied that it discriminated against the passengers in two separate incidents but agreed it could have handled the situations differently, according to a consent order released Friday by the US Transportation Department.The department alleged that Delta violated anti-bias laws by removing the passengers, and ordered the airline to provide cultural-sensitivity training to pilots, flight attendants and customer-service agents involved in the incidents.In one of the cases, in July 2016 in Paris, a passenger told a flight attendant that a couple made her nervous. The woman was wearing a head scarf, and  the other passenger claimed  the man inserted something in his phone. The flight attendant said she walked by and saw the man writing Allah\" several times while texting on his phone.At the captain\\'s request, a Delta supervisor and security officer interviewed the couple outside the plane. Delta\\'s corporate security office reported that the couple were U.S. citizens returning home to Cincinnati and raised no red flags,\" and they were cleared to fly, according to the consent order. But the captain refused to let them re-board the plane; they flew home the next day.The Transportation Department said it appears that the couple would have been allowed to fly but for their perceived religion.\"The couple was not named in the consent order, but their representatives identified them as Faisal and Nazia Ali of the Cincinnati, Ohio, area.The other case in the consent order occurred five days later in Amsterdam. Flight attendants and passengers complained about a Muslim passenger, but the co-pilot saw nothing unusual about the man, and Delta\\'s security office said his record raised no concern.The captain prepared to begin the New York-bound flight, then returned to the gate and had the man and his bags removed and the area around his seat searched. The man was not subjected to additional screening before boarding a later flight, which the Transportation Department said showed that his removal from the first flight was discriminatory.The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which represented the Alis, questioned the size of the penalty.Delta earned nearly $4.8 billion last year, and for a company that profitable, $50,000 is basically a slap on the wrist,\" said Karen Dabdoub, executive director of CAIR\\'s Cincinnati chapter.But it\\'s a good sign that DOT is taking this seriously,\" she added. I\\'m glad to see that Delta received some sort of a sanction.\"The government did not explain how the size of the fine was determined but said that it establishes a strong deterrent against future similar unlawful practices by Delta and other carriers.\"Delta disagreed with the government\\'s contention of discrimination, but Delta does not dispute that each of these two incidents could have been handled differently,\" the government said in the consent order.Delta said that in both cases, it acted based on the passengers\\' behavior, not their identity, and its employees acted reasonably. In the case of the Alis, one of the complaining customers identified herself as a retired safety inspector for the Federal Aviation Administration, the airline said.The Atlanta-based airline said that after the 2016 incidents it improved its procedures for investigating suspicious behavior to make it more collaborative and objective.\"',\n",
       " 'US intelligence authorities urged British counterparts to keep a close eye on Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after they became aware of a plan by Saudi Arabia to keep her under surveillance in the UK last year, according to western intelligence sources.The US believed the kingdom had the ambition and intention to monitor Cengiz in London last May, seven months after Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to obtain papers so the couple could marry.It is not clear if the intended surveillance of Cengiz was electronic or physical, or if it was successful.However, the revelation that intelligence agencies feared Cengiz was being targeted in this way  and that Saudi Arabia was preparing to do so in the UK so soon after the outcry over Khashoggis murder  will have caused alarm in the diplomatic community.It will also highlight the concerns of human rights activists, who have long argued the Saudis are using surveillance to monitor and intimidate dissidents and critics of the kingdom.Saudi Arabia is trying to put a lid on the whole [Khashoggi] thing, so it is understandable that they would try to make sure that Hatices voice and advocacy is limited, said Hala Aldosari, a Saudi activist and fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). All sorts of unlawful behaviour continues, nothing has changed.Cengiz, who is Turkish, has been an outspoken advocate for justice for Khashoggi, who was killed in October 2018.US intelligence officials have determined with a medium to high degree of confidence that the killing was ordered by Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Saudi Arabia has denied the prince was personally involved.The Guardians revelations about the effort by US and British authorities to ensure Cengiz was protected follows a report by the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius that the US state department recently rejected a proposal by a US defence company, DynCorp, to train Saudi intelligence services because the kingdom did not have proper safeguards in place to prevent lawless covert operations like the killing of Khashoggi.The column cited two ongoing US government concerns: that Saud al-Qahtani, a close adviser to the crown prince who has been sanctioned for his role in arranging the murder, was still operating behind the scenes, and that there were reports that Cengiz and one of Khashoggis sons had been under Saudi surveillance in London last summer.A spokesperson for the state department said: We have no comment on this issue. US intelligence agencies are required under law to warn individuals if they are known to face an imminent risk of murder, kidnapping and serious bodily harm, according to a 2015 directive that is known as the duty to warn.The revelation about Cengiz suggests that, far from reining in a Saudi campaign to silence critics at home and abroad, the Saudi government is reinforcing what one former Obama administration official called the states posture to monitor dissidents and critics.They use a variety of tools as a matter of course. It is state policy, said Andrew Miller, a Middle East expert who served on the national security council under Barack Obama. The second point is that obviously the fallout from the Khashoggi murder has not fundamentally changed the Saudi states posture. Fortunately no one else has been kidnapped and killed but they are still pursuing information about their opponents. New details about the surveillance concerns will ignite further criticism of the Saudi government as UN investigators have called for a thorough examination of new claims that Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Washington Post, was seemingly hacked after being sent a WhatsApp video file from the personal account of Prince Mohammed.Agns Callamard and David Kaye, UN special rapporteurs who are investigating the matter, have pointed to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents of the kingdom, especially people who are of strategic importance.Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, has declined to comment publicly, but this week tweeted a picture of himself standing next to Cengiz at a memorial for Khashoggi in Istanbul. He used the hashtag #Jamal in the post.A spokesman for Saudi Arabia in Washington did not return a request for comment. The Guardian contacted Cengizs assistant, but Cengiz declined to provide a comment.Saudi Arabia has previously denied using surveillance tools against human rights activists and critics of the kingdom. It has described the allegations about the hacking of Bezoss phone as absurd.The Guardian reported last year that the CIA alerted counterparts in Norway to a potential Saudi threat against a pro-democracy activist called Iyad el-Baghdadi, a frequent critic of the Saudi regime who lives under asylum protection in Norway.The alert on 25 April  about seven months after the killing of Khashoggi  prompted Norwegian authorities to rush to Baghdadis residence.Baghdadi said in a phone interview with the Guardian at the time: The way I understood it was, the Saudis have a crosshairs on me, but there is no idea of what they are going to do.This article was amended on 23 January 2020 to correct a picture caption.',\n",
       " 'Like millions of other kids, for Varun Dhawan, too, Republic Day always meant waking up early and sitting glued to the TV, watching the colourful parade. And thats something which hasnt changed at all. Even now, I get up early on the Republic Day and watch the parade just as excitedly. Thats like a ritual in our house, says the actor, who has just had a new film [Street Dancer 3D] release on Friday. As India celebrates its 71st Republic Day, we catch up with the actor for an exclusive photo shoot and interview. Excerpts: What are your earliest memories of Republic Day?My earliest memories are of me waking up early and watching the parade on Doordarshan. I vividly remember how dad [film director David Dhawan] would explain things to me. Then, a big, special memory is from last year when I travelled to the Wagah border on January 26 and performed a song for the jawans and about 10,000 other people. Just being able to chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai at Wagah was amazing. What, according to you, is the best thing about India being a republic?I think India stands as a great example of being a flourishing republic. Over the years, we have functioned very well as a country for many years, while maintaining the love and harmony between people. Personally, I feel there are a lot of good things about our country, and its a great day to celebrate all those things.You are a youth icon. What do you think India epitomises for the young people of the country?For me, India will always be symbolic of warmth, kindness and love. The ethos of our nation  what our parents have always taught us  such as being nice to everyone, treating everyone as equal and not judging anyone on the basis of skin colour, culture or race, are amazing. These things have been instilled in me. So, I am always going to be like that. There is a very nice humane factor in our country which I dont think many countries have. If any country goes through a problem, India is one of the first nations to offer a helping hand, and I think, that is the greatness of our nation.Also see: Shah Rukh Khan takes a dig at himself in hilarious video as Raees completes three years, watch videoAnd are you a patriot?Yes, absolutely, and I have been that way since childhood. And why not? Its an absolutely fantastic feeling to love your country because eventually, we are what we are because of our nation; we are safe thanks to it. The idea of loving our country should be protected. We are all grateful to our jawans at the border for keeping us safe. But I feel, in a democracy, everyone should contribute. We cant have the attitude that someone else will do a certain job for us. For instance, if you want the country to be clean, you should ensure that you dont litter, and must stop others from littering. Likewise, if you want pollution levels to be lower, then go the car pool way, or ensure that your car emits no/less pollutants. That way, everyone can make a difference in their own way by doing small things. Two days before Republic Day, you had a film release. It must be a doubly special feelingI just hope that people use this holiday and watch Street Dancer 3D with their families, especially since its a complete family film and also talks about what actually is Indian-ness of India. Plus, of course, like a typical Bollywood entertainer, theres a lot of fun and entertainment in the film. We Indians love to dance and celebrate, and what better than this occasion for a celebration. So, I feel that a lot of people should come to theatres and celebrate with us (laughs).What, according to you, is the essence of India that we all should be proud of? For starters, I feel everyone should be very proud of being an Indian. Plus, we all should use our democratic right to vote, as thats the most powerful way to make sure that your voice is heard. Its not enough to just write your views on social media platforms. You must exercise your right of franchise. Another thing we all should vow to do is keep our country clean. Thats why a movement like Swachh Bharat mission, brought in by our Prime Minister, Narendra Modiji, is very important. I personally believe that a clean country will always be a happy one.Follow @htshowbiz for more',\n",
       " 'Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane defended Gareth Bale on Saturday after the Welshman picking up another injury and also said Eden Hazard is close to a return. Bale will miss Madrids La Liga game against Real Valladolid on Sunday after he sprained his ankle during Madrids Copa del Rey win over Unionistas de Salamanca on Wednesday. Bale had opened the scoring in a 3-1 victory. It is his third injury this season. Bale spent just over a month out before Christmas with calf and thigh problems. He missed Real Madrids Spanish Super Cup triumph in Saudi Arabia through illness earlier this month and the game against Unionistas was his first match back. When he is available, which is the most important thing, he is fine, Zidane said in a press conference on Saturday. The pity is that the other day he hurt his ankle and he is now unavailable. He is as unhappy about it as anyone, he would like to be with us, to train and play, but its a small thing. I hope to see him back with us on Monday. Bales relationship with Zidane has been tense in the past and he came close to leaving Real Madrid last summer, before a move to China fell through. The 30-year-old is not expected to be sold mid-season but a departure could suit everyone in the summer. Asked if he was tired of defending Bale, Zidane said: The other day he scored. I will always defend my players. They are my players, they train every day, they fight for each other. There is a good dynamic, all the players are desperate to wear the badge of Real Madrid. They all have their own history but I dont see that as a bad thing. It is true Gareth has had some injuries and you cant do anything about that. You can think what you want but when I am with him, what he wants is to be available, to be with the team. Bales recovery could coincide with a return for Hazard, who has also endured an injury-interrupted season since his move from Chelsea last summer. The Belgian sustained a fracture in his foot in November but has begun light training, meaning he could feature in the derby against Atletico Madrid on February 1. I cannot say when he will be back but he has started to touch the ball again, Zidane said. His progress is good, he no longer feels pain. Starting Monday, he will start working individually with more ballwork. Hazard missed almost a month at the start of the season with a hamstring strain before injuring his foot on November 26 against Paris Saint-Germain. Real Madrid are unbeaten in 18 games and sit second in La Liga, behind Barcelona on goal difference.',\n",
       " 'New Delhi: A public interest litigation (PIL) has been moved in the Supreme Court, seeking the quashing of a recent direction of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on dues related to adjusted gross revenue (AGR).The DoT on Thursday said it will not take coercive action against telecom companies that failed to meet the court-directed 23 January deadline to pay dues, after Vodafone Idea Limited and Bharti Airtel Limited sought more time.The plea, filed by Consumer Rights Foundation, said the DoTs order amounts to contempt of court.It has asked for directions to DoT to take immediate steps/action to ensure immediate recovery of the dues from the said companies in terms of the Supreme Court order dated 24 October, adding that the government was duty bound to abide by the order passed by the apex court.The 24 October order that ended a 14-year legal battle between telcos and the department of telecommunications (DoT) asked Indias top wireless carriers to cough up more than  1 trillion in dues, straining their already precarious financial situation.For that an amount of more than  1,47,000 crores is not a small sum whose recovery can be postponed or delayed despite specific directions of this Honble Court at peril of detriment of the citizens of this country from whom these TSPs (telecom service providers) have already collected huge amounts and earned revenue,\" the plea said.For that it is humbly submitted that these dues which have been adjudicated in favour of the Government by this Honble Court are not simpliciter private contractual dues of the Central Government but, in essence, public money and thereby involves substantial public interest. The TSPs (telecom service providers) after having collected huge amounts from the consumers cannot be allowed to wriggle of its obligation to pay the dues as per the Licence Agreements and definition of AGR as held by this Honble Court,\" it added.',\n",

The autographed microphones were the first ever items to be sold at auction from BTS, Juliens said. The auction house had previously estimated that the set would sell for between $10,000 and $20,000. BTS, a seven-member boy band with a message of self-confidence, has spearheaded a wave of Korean pop music beyond Asia and into the United States just six years after its 2013 debut. In 2019, BTS became the first group since the Beatles to score three No. 1 albums in a year on the Billboard 200 charts. The microphones sold at auction were used from 2017 to 2019 on the bands Love Yourself tour. The auction was held to benefit the Recording Academys charitable arm, MusiCares. Also sold were items from Aerosmith, Pete Townsend, Stevie Nicks, the late Tom Petty and others.  BTS is among the acts scheduled to perform at Sundays Grammy Awards.

       " 'Beijing: As the coronavirus turned virulent, India is understood to have requested China to permit over 250 Indian students stuck in Wuhan, the epicentre of the new SARS-like virus, to leave the city, sources here said on Saturday.About 700 Indian students, mostly medical students, are believed to be studying in different universities in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. Authorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the heart of the viral outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1,300 people and killed 41 others.While majority of the Indian students left for home on Chinese New Year holidays, over 250 to 300 students are said to be still in the city and its surrounding areas. Besides the students, the fast spreading virus has become a major worry for their parents back home.Some students managed to leave the city just before it was sealed off on January 23. India has stepped up monitoring of passengers arriving from China, especially from Wuhan.The sources here said that in view of the prevailing situation, India has requested both the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the local officials in Wuhan to consider making arrangements for the Indian students to leave.Asked whether China would consider any request of countries to move their citizens out of Wuhan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told media here on Thursday that, We always help foreign consular officials in China in their official jobs, we offer them all the assistance and convenience necessary and we work to guarantee foreign citizens legitimate rights and interest in China\".While specific details would be provided by local officials, he said China in principle always handles issues according to domestic laws, international laws and bilateral consular agreements.Authorities have extended transport bans to 17 other cities around Wuhan in an effort to control the SARS-like virus, restricting travel for around 56 million in Hubei province.On Saturday, the city officials have also banned all private transport in the city as part of stepped up measures to ensure little movement in the city.While India has earlier issued travel advisories to Indians travelling to China in view the coronavirus, the Indian Embassy here in the last few days has set up hotlines for the students in Wuhan to extend assistance and has talked to local officials about proper supply of food and other necessities for them.

       " 'The United States strongly urges Pakistan to fulfill its counterterrorism obligations as laid out for it by a global watchdog because the consequences of its failure would be devastating for its ongoing IMF-aded economic reforms, a top American diplomat said Friday.The watchdog body, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), is meeting in Beijing currently to review Pakistans progress and determine if it has done enough to be elevated from the grey list of nations with suspect counterterrorism measures to the black list of the most egregious offenders.Leaks about the secretive bodys deliberations, mostly in Pakistan media, indicate Pakistan might have fulfilled most if not all the obligations and may escape being pushed to the black list, which could imperil the 2019 IMF bailout package of $6 billion and the economic reforms tied to it.We strongly encourage Pakistan to work with FATF and the international community to fully satisfy its action plan commitments, Alice Wells, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, told reporters a a briefing on her recent visit to the region.Completion of the FATF action plan is critical to Pakistans economic reform efforts, including its IMF program, as well as for demonstrating sustained and irreversible action against all militant groups based in Pakistan without distinction, she added, in an unmistakable reference to Pakistans well-known tendency to act against bad terrorists, who were inimical to its own interests, and support and finance the good terrorists, who serve Pakistans foreign policy goals of disrupting neighbors such as India and Afghanistan.If Pakistan were not to meet FATF obligations or were to fail and be blacklisted, that would be devastating for Pakistans economic reform program and for its ability to attract investors, she added in response to a question about implications of Pakistans blacklisting for the IMF bailout.The United States was instrumental in the grey listing of Pakistan in June 2018 by the 39-member FATF, overriding stiff resistance from China and Turkey, two of Pakistans close allies. Islamabad has been since working on implementing a list of conditions laid down by the watchdog to avoid being bumped up to the blacklist, and, under the most optimistic circumstances, be taken off the grey list altogether.',\n",
       " 'Sonos Inc. Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence apologized to customers after a backlash over the companys plan to halt software updates for older products.The Santa Barbara, California-based speaker maker earlier this week said it would stop providing updates and new features for speakers launched in the 2000s, including the Connect, ZonePlayer, the original Play:5 and Bridge.The company warned that even if customers only had one older speaker, their entire Sonos sound systems might lose access to services and functionality would eventually be disrupted. It also suggested users buy new speakers with a 30% credit for each legacy device traded in. Sonos devotees quickly went berserk on social media, accusing the company of purposely degrading existing hardware to spur new sales.I have over 1000USD of *speakers* that must be retired now? Terrible product life cycle support, Scott Jenson, a longtime Google executive, wrote on Twitter. I clearly have no choice to upgrade but Im certainly NOT going to trust my money with Sonos ever again.In a statement Thursday, Sonos didnt reverse the decision to nix software updates in May, but pledged to keep older speakers updated with bug fixes and security patches for as long as possible. The company also said it would work to offer an alternative solution to major issues that cant be addressed.We heard you. We did not get this right from the start. My apologies for that and I wanted to personally assure you of the path forward, Spence wrote in a letter posted on Sonoss blog. First, rest assured that come May, when we end new software updates for our legacy products, they will continue to work as they do today. We are not bricking them, we are not forcing them into obsolescence, and we are not taking anything away.Sonoss original announcement suggested that legacy products would eventually stop working with newer speakers. On Thursday, the company said that would no longer be the case. We are working on a way to split your system so that modern products work together and get the latest features, while legacy products work together and remain in their current state, Spence wrote. Jenson applauded the response on TwitterDespite the backlash, its common for technology companies to cut off software updates for older devices. Apple Inc.s latest iOS operating system doesnt support iPhones sold before 2015 and iPads made before 2014. That spurs millions of people to spend hundreds of dollars buying new handsets.Sonos is under pressure from larger rivals including Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Google, which sell internet-connected speakers with digital assistants built in. Sonos sued Google recently, accusing the tech giant of ripping off its designs.Spence testified at a Congressional antitrust hearing this month and argued that Sonos was different from larger rivals because it supports products for many years. Our business model is simple  we sell products which people pay for once, and we make them better over time with software updates, Spence said.Some users on Twitter quickly contrasted that statement with this weeks decision to end software updates on many speakers.',\n",

       " 'To prevent sexual abuse of children and contain access to and transmission of child pornographic content on social media, a Rajya Sabha panel has made 40 recommendations, including making monitoring apps mandatory on all devices and amending the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Information Technology Act. The report was presented to Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu by the panel chief and Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh. The initiative of Naidu in setting up such a committee to examine and report on an issue of such a wider social concern is the first of its kind and has been widely appreciated. Ramesh, in the report, stated that it is a good model that can be followed from time to time to get members of the Rajya Sabha to deliberate on pressing social issues. Expressing concern over the seriousness of the prevalence of the horrific social evil of child pornography, the committee has recommended important amendments to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 besides technological, institutional, social and educational measures and state-level initiatives to address the alarming issue of pornography on social media and its effects on children and the society as a whole. The committee urged the Prime Minister to take up the subject of child pornography and the measures required to combat it in one of his forthcoming Mann Ki Baat radio broadcast, besides taking the lead in building up a global political alliance to combat child pornography on social media on the lines of the International Solar Alliance initiative. The 40 recommendations made by the ad-hoc committee relate to adoption of a broader definition of child pornography, controlling access for children to such content, containing generation and dissemination of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), making accountable the Internet service providers and online platforms for denying access to children and removing such obscene content from online sites, besides monitoring, detection and removal of such content. It also suggested enabling effective action by governments and authorised agencies to take necessary preventive and penal measures. Noting that the purveyors of child pornography seem always to be one step ahead of the regulators, the committee stressed on the need for implementation of its recommendations as an integrated package of measures and not piecemeal to have any value and impact. The committee has recommended some important amendments to the POCSO Act, 2012 and the IT Act, 2000 with corresponding changes to be carried out in the Indian Penal Code. It has sought inclusions of a clause in the POCSO Act, 2012 under which advocating or counseling sexual activities with a person under the age of 18 years through any written material, visual representation or audio recording or any characterisation is made an offence under the Act. It has also sought another clause to be inserted in the POCSO Act prescribing a Code of Conduct for intermediaries (online platforms) for maintaining child safety online, ensuring age appropriate content and curbing use of children for pornographic purposes. Under the POCSO Act, school management should be responsible for safety of children within schools, transportation services and any other programmes with which the school is associated, the panel said. National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal shall be designated as the national portal under reporting requirements in POCSO Act in case of electronic material, the committee said, adding that a new section be included in the IT Act 2000, providing for punitive measures for those providing pornographic access to children and also those who access, produce or transmit Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). It also recommended that the Union Government shall be empowered through its designated authority to block and/or prohibit all websites/intermediaries that carry child sexual abuse material. The committee demanded the IT Act be modified making intermediaries responsible for all measures to proactively identify and remove CSAM as well as report it to Indian authorities as well, besides the foreign authorities.    Gateway Internet Service Providers (ISPs) must bear a significant liability to detect and block CSAM websites.    Intermediaries shall also be responsible to report to the designated authority, IP addresses/identities of all those searching/accessing child porn/CSAM key words. It also recommended that Law enforcement agencies be permitted to brake end-to-end encryption to trace distributors of child pornography.    Apps that help in monitoring childrens access to pornographic content shall be made mandatory on all devices sold in India. Such Apps or similar solutions to be developed and made freely available to ISP, companies, schools and parents. The committee has broadly sought to address two main issues -- access of children to pornographic material on social media and circulation of pornographic material on social media in which children are abused.',\n",

Such projects are worth  3 lakh crore and the marathon meetings are intended to iron out issues and explore ways to fast track pending projects.The audit will be done on the basis of a bunch of parameters if they are able to complete the allocated work in time, their problem resolution skills and initiative towards taking responsibility at work.The audit (of road ministry and NHAI officials) will be dovetailed with annual appraisal review,\" road secretary Sanjeev Ranjan said.Last week, the minister sent a strong message and warned non-performing officials in his ministry who neither take decisions nor allow others to work of showing exit door and said that red-tapism will not be tolerated.In a meeting in November, Prime Minister had also said directed bureaucrats that the long delayed projects should be expedited by the respective state governments and regular reports on the progress of such projects must be sent to his office.The minister instructed all chief engineers in the highways ministry and all members of NHAI to organise review Mondays on the first and third Monday of every month.On these days no meetings other than for the purpose of review will be held by officials.

       " 'Giovanni Ferrero, scion of the Italian chocolate empire that makes Kinder Surprise, Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, is paying himself and his family a 642m (542m) dividend in one of Europes biggest-ever paydays.The huge annual dividend payment comes as the company paid just 110,000 tax in the UK last year, despite selling 419m worth of chocolates and other snacks in Britain.Ferrero, who is Italys richest man with a 29bn (24bn) fortune, has paid himself and his family more than 2bn in dividends over the past decade. Over the same period the company, which also owns TicTacs and the UKs 109-year-old chocolate brand Thorntons, paid less than 500,000 in UK taxes.Tax experts have accused the company of structuring the business in a complex manner in order to pay as little tax as possible. Last year the UK business paid a 334m cost of sales charge to Ferreros holding company in low-tax Luxembourg. That led to the company making a pre-tax profit of just 9.7m , and the firm paid UK taxes of just 110,000.Ferrero UK said it had lost so much money in the UK over the years that it had stored up unused tax losses of 22.5m available for offset against future profits.Robert Leach, a tax accountant, said: Ferrero Rocher appears to be shifting its profits overseas to reduce its UK tax liability. The company is shifting the profits to Luxembourg, and shifting that to Monaco  where there are no taxes.The UK company accounts show that Ferrero has not broken even for many years. No parent company would keep a loss-making company going year after year, the fact that Ferrero Group is doing so is in effect an admission that it is exporting profits.Basically, this is chocolate and hazelnut wrapped in some fancy packaging  it should not cost much to make. So I would ask the company, what is costing 334m? I would ask Giovanni Ferrero, Why are you still selling chocolate in the UK, when you dont make a profit?Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who hopes to be re-elected as chairwoman of the Commons business select committee, said the government must intervene to prevent companies such as Ferrero using opaque tax arrangements to cheat the taxpayer.The rules for firms like Ferrero Rocher and everyone else are simple: tax should be paid where the revenue is earned, she said. If the money is earned in the UK, the tax should be going to the Treasury to help fund public services like education and health on which these firms rely.The government needs to stop sitting on its hands and act to stop firms diverting potential UK tax revenues to offshore destinations.British business is broken. We need far more scrutiny and transparency about the tax structures of these increasingly complex companies. At present, the big losers under the current system are British taxpayers, while the winners are the big firms swelling their profit, boardroom salaries and dividends on the back of some highly questionable tax arrangements.Giovanni Ferrero, 55, Ferrero Groups executive chairman and grandson of Pietro Ferrero  who founded the company in a small pastry shop in Alba, northwest Italy in 1946  approved the huge dividend after the company made record profits of 928m last year.The dividend is paid to the Ferrero familys private wealth management office FEDESA in Monaco (where no income tax is payable), as reported by Bloomberg. A spokeswoman for the company and the family declined to comment.Ferrero Group is entirely owned by the Ferrero family, but the company declined to state how much of the firm is owned by each family member. The dividend payments have lifted the family up the global wealth rankings, and in 2008 they overtook the family of media tycoon and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to become Italys richest family. Berlusconi has fallen to the fourth-richest Italian with a 7.4bn fortune.Giovanni Ferrero is the richest person in Italy and the worlds 27th-wealthiest, sandwiched between Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, and the Tesla founder, Elon Musk, according to the estimates calculated by the Bloomberg Billionaires list.He took over as co-chief executive with his brother, Pietro Ferrero Jr, following the death of their father, Michele Ferrero, in Monaco in 2015. Pietro, the chosen heir, died of a heart attack in 2011 while cycling in South Africa, leaving Giovanni as the sole CEO. He moved on to become executive chairman in 2017.Michele Ferrero was known for commuting by helicopter every day from his Monte Carlo villa to the company headquarters in Alba, Piedmont. This article was amended on 31 January 2020 to make it clear that it is no income tax which is payable in Monaco.',\n",

So, while the outsider-insider debate has been storming the film industry for quite some time now, he gives his take as honestly as possible, and has no qualms in admitting that he is not a self-made person, and would have perhaps not made it had it not been for his father, popular film producer, Allu Aravind. Read: Allu Arjun says he wants a pan-India appeal: For which I need to do a Bollywood filmI can definitely never claim that I am a self-made person, because its not true and I completely accept it. Having a person from the family in the industry always helps. His (Allu Aravinds) presence got me a break easily That is a huge thing in your initial years. There is someone to help, support and most importantly, guide you through your mistakes. Thats an advantage, and Im thankful I had that in my life during those developing years, he smiles. But the star of Race Gurram (2014), Rudhramadevi (2015) and Naa Peru Surya, Naa Illu India (2018) explains once youre in, everything depends on the person.

When the light goes off, in that darkness, on that screen Ill have to impress the audience in the next three hours in my individual capacity if they dont accept me, my performance, my career goes nowhere. And I must continue doing the same So in the long run, the initial push becomes a smaller factor, elucidates the actor, who gets emotional talking about his father, especially the things he has learned.

Flags will be hoisted at 8.30 am in accordance with the stipulated time and a copy of the preamble was also sent along with the circular to the mosques. The country is passing through a critical phase. We cant remain silent for long. Members of the Muslim community are feeling insecure like never before. Such acts will promote national integration and give them enough confidence, said chairman of the state Wakf Board T K Hamsa, also a state committee member of the ruling CPI (M).In Malabar, north Kerala, many religious bodies have announced such programmes even before the circular of the Wakf Board.Meanwhile, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) has decided to form a human chain (Manushya Maha Sringala) across the length of the state on Republic Day. It will cover ten of the 14 districts of the state. The LDF claimed that it will be the largest congregation since the anti-CAA protests began in the country last month.LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan said at least 7 million people were expected to participate in the human chain.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Friday that Chinas Communist Party had created a surveillance state that uses artificial intelligence to repress Muslim minorities and pro-democracy demonstrators.  China has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who call Xinjiang home. As we speak, the Communist Party of China is using artificial intelligence to repress Muslin minority communities and pro-democracy demonstrators, Esper said during a speech in Washington. In fact, the party has constructed  a 21st century surveillance state with unprecedented abilities to censor speech and infringe upon basic human rights, Esper added. George Orwell would be proud.  Orwells 1984 novel features a Big Brother government that spies on its citizens and forces them into doublethink, or simultaneously accepting contradictory versions of the truth. The Chinese government has ramped up personal surveillance in Xinjiang over recent years, including the construction of an extensive video surveillance system and smartphone monitoring technology. China says Xinjiang is its internal affair, and the issue there is not a religious or ethnic one, but about preventing terrorism and separatism. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has been embroiled by more than seven months of turmoil sparked by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial. The youth-led protests, including mass marches, petrol bomb attacks and battles on university campuses, have since morphed into a broader revolt against authorities and strong-arm Chinese rule.

We have taken decisive action to protect religious liberty, he added.Following Trumps brief remarks, the crowd broke into a chant of four more years, a reference to the November vote, when Christian evangelical support will be crucial to Trumps re-election.I vote pro-life, said signs held by members of the crowd.Trump made only a single reference to the impeachment trial going on just down the street that could see him removed from office for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice, he told the crowd. And we will win because we know how to win. Beverly Atkins, 55, drove 13 hours from Alabama to attend the rally.Life begins at conception, Atkins told AFP. We dont think you should destroy that. As for impeachment, she said Democrats have no evidence that Trump did anything wrong.The seven Democratic impeachment managers are to make their final arguments at Trumps Senate trial on Friday.White House lawyers will then have 24 hours, starting at 10:00 am (1500 GMT) on Saturday, to present their defense of the president, who was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18.Impeachment may forever stain his record, but Trump is virtually assured of acquittal by the Republican-held Senate -- and he is already looking past the trial to the re-election fight that awaits.Before entering politics Trump defended abortion rights, but he has increasingly aligned himself with the anti-abortion movement as he works to firm up his electoral base.I love Trump, said Jim Bolognio, 63, who came to the rally from New Jersey. These people are going to reelect him. My daughter is adopted, Bolognio added.She wouldnt be here if her mother didnt choose the right path. Brayden Harris, 16, who came to Washington from Hershey, Pennsylvania, with the pro-life club of his school, said abortion is wrong. God says he knows you before youre even born, so in the womb he knows you, Harris said. Its what it says in the Bible.The March for Life, which Trump had addressed by video the last two years, is held annually on or near the anniversary of the Supreme Courts ruling in the Roe v Wade case which legalized the procedure nationwide on January 22, 1973.Under Trumps presidency, abortion rights activists fear that landmark ruling is now under threat.Since day one, this administration has carried out a full-out assault on our health and our rights, said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which supports abortion rights.Since taking office in 2017, Trump has strengthened the Supreme Courts 5-4 conservative majority, naming two justices who oppose abortion -- Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- and galvanizing abortion opponents.Conservative-leaning Chief Justice John Roberts is seen as the potential swing vote if the constitutionality of abortion eventually comes before the court.Around two-thirds of Americans say abortion should be legal, polls suggest.But while Roe v Wade remains the law of the land, numerous states have taken measures to limit access to the procedure.The first big Supreme Court test of that anti-abortion push will come in March, when the court examines a Louisiana law whose restrictions on abortion are similar to a Texas law struck down nearly four years ago.Like each year, the march wound its way from the National Mall towards the Supreme Court near the Capitol, where senators are sitting as jurors in Trumps impeachment trial.Republicans hold a 53 to 47 edge in the Senate and a two-thirds majority of the 100 senators would be needed to convict and remove the president from office.',\n",
       " 'Four men, all of whom have direct connections to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the global coronavirus pandemic, have been confirmed as carrying the deadly virus in Australia.A man in his 50s in Melbourne became the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus in Australia on Saturday morning, with three other cases confirmed in New South Wales late on Saturday.Eleven countries have now confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), 41 people have died and more than 1,000 have been infected.Victorias health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said the man in Melbourne, a Chinese national, arrived at Tullamarine airport at 9am on Sunday 19 January on China Southern Airlines Flight No CZ321 from Guangzhou. He had previously been in Wuhan.The man tested positive for coronavirus early on Saturday morning. He had visited a GP on Thursday and went to the Monash medical centre at Clayton on Friday, where he was put into isolation.The man showed no symptoms while travelling, so may not have been contagious at the time, Mikakos said. But out of an abundance of caution health officials were contacting everybody who was on that flight.There is no reason for alarm in the general community, Mikakos said. We have strict protocols that are in place in terms of how we deal with these infectious disease outbreaks.Mikakos said the first infected man and his family did everything right.He exhibited no symptoms on the flight and when he did experience some symptoms of illness they contacted the GP on Thursday, they called ahead and he was double-masked when he presented to the GP clinic.He was not confirmed to have coronavirus by the GP. The family contacted the Monash medical centre on Friday, they called ahead of time and again he was masked before he turned up at [emergency] and immediately put into isolation.The three other confirmed Australian cases, all in New South Wales, involve men aged between 30 and 60. Two had visited Wuhan in recent weeks, the other had direct contact with a confirmed case from Wuhan while in China.A man in his 50s arrived in Sydney from Wuhan on China Eastern flight MU749 on 20 January. He developed symptoms that night and subsequently saw a doctor.Another man, who is in his 30s, arrived in Sydney from China on 6 January. He did not develop symptoms until 15 January and saw his GP. He did not visit Wuhan but had contact with a person from the city diagnosed with coronavirus.A third man, in his 40s, arrived in Sydney on 18 January after being in Wuhan. He did not develop symptoms until 24 January and presented to hospital on the same day.All three men were diagnosed with novel coronavirus on Saturday 25 January. All three are currently in isolation in NSW hospitals.A total of 18 people have been tested for the virus in NSW, with 12 of those given the all-clear.The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, urged anyone with symptoms to come forward as soon as they felt unwell.It is important people feel confident contacting their GP or local emergency department, he said. They should also call ahead to speak to their GP or emergency department. If the GP considers novel coronavirus testing is needed they will be referred to the emergency department for testing.Nine people in Queensland have returned negative results for coronavirus, with authorities on Saturday still waiting on results from another possible case.Four people in South Australia were also being tested but authorities said it was unlikely they actually had the virus, with a man also being checked in a Hobart hospital.Australias chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said the man in Melbourne confirmed as having coronavirus had visited Wuhan province but had come to Australia on a direct flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne.He said there are potentially others like this person ... who was well when he travelled, but that there was no evidence this virus is being transmitted in Australia.At this stage there is no risk to the general Australian community, Murphy said.But he said there was significant potential for more cases in Australia.There are other cases being tested each day. I wouldnt be surprised if we have further confirmed cases.Murphy said that anyone who had travelled from China who developed flu-like symptoms should see their doctor.The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, announced the Australian government had raised its travel advice for Hubei province in central China to level four  the highest level.We now advise you: do not travel to and from Hubei province, the government advised.Payne said: Chinese authorities have restricted travel in at least five Hubei cities. Australians going there may not be able to leave until restrictions are lifted.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said a confirmed case of coronavirus had been anticipated by the Australian government and the issue was being addressed incredibly seriously.I want to assure Australians that our officials, our medical experts, our clinicians, our border security officials and agencies, our biosecurity professionals are all working closely together at both a commonwealth and state level, he said.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has listed the virus as having pandemic potential. This allows for enhanced border protection measures.Globally, efforts to contain the deadly new coronavirus have been stepped up, and the first cases have been reported in Europe.China has widened restrictions on movement, expanding its unprecedented lockdown during the countrys new year holiday period to 13 cities, covering at least 36 million people.Late on Friday, authorities confirmed a further 15 deaths and 180 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of fatalities to 41 people and more than 1,000 people affected.Cases have been reported in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand and Vietnam. On Friday, the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three cases.The World Health Organisation has stopped short of declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern but called on the international community to work co-operatively to fight the spread of the virus.There is an emerging suspicion in China that officials may be downplaying the number of cases recorded over recent weeks, recalling the governments reluctance to disclose the full scale of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which killed almost 800 people.Videos circulating on Weibo and other social media, reportedly from Hubei hospitals, show crowded waiting rooms and distressed and overwhelmed medical staff. Patients have reported being turned away from hospitals, which have been inundated with people who fear they have the virus.Health facilities in Wuhan are reportedly running out of beds and diagnostic kits for patients who present with fever-like symptoms, which could mean many are unsure if they have the virus.Initial symptoms of coronavirus are similar to those of a cold and flu, and include a cough or fever.Most of the people who have died in the outbreak have been older men but on Friday Chinese authorities confirmed a 36-year-old man had died, the youngest fatality so far.',\n",
       " 'Rahul Mishra and Imane Ayissi made history Thursday by becoming the first Indian and black African designers to show their clothes on the elite Paris haute couture catwalk.Only a little more than a dozen of the worlds most prestigious luxury labels -- including Dior, Chanel and Givenchy -- have a right to call their clothes haute couture.All the clothes must be handmade -- and go on to sell for tens of thousands of euros (dollars) to some of the richest and most famous women in the world.Mishra, an advocate of ethical slow fashion who blames mechanisation for much of the worlds ills, said it felt amazing and very surreal to be the first Indian to be chosen.They see a great future for us -- which will make us push ourselves even harder, the 40-year-old told AFP after his debut show was cheered by fashionistas.Both Mishra and Cameroon-born Ayissi, 51, are champions of traditional fabrics and techniques from their homelands and are famous for their classy lines.- Immense for Africa -Ayissi said his selection was immense both for Africa and himself.I am so proud that I can show my work and showcase real African fabrics and African heritage, he told AFP backstage as celebrities, including the chic head of Unesco, Audrey Azoulay, congratulated him.Mishra broke through on the Paris ready-to-wear scene after winning the International Woolmark Prize in 2014, the top award that also launched the careers of such greats as Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent.The purity of his often white creations with their detailed but understated embroidery has won him many fans, including Vogues legendary critic Suzy Menkes.The doyenne of fashions front row called him an Indian national treasure.But this time, Mishra turned up the colour palette somewhat with dresses that subtly evoked the jungle paradises and pristine underwater world off the Maldives he worries that one day we might lose.- Delhi smoke dreams -Appalled by the smoke and pollution that meant he had to keep his four-year-old daughter indoors in Delhi for nearly 20 days in November, Mishra said he imagined a pure virginal and untamed planet... with ecosystems crafted out of embroidered flora and fauna.I am very emotional about it. Sometimes it makes me cry. All our children should be growing up in a better world, he added.When I take Aarna (his daughter) to the foothills of the Himalayas and the sky turns blue, she is so happy. Once, when she saw the River Ganges, she said: Can you please clean it for us so can go for a swim?Mishra said he was reducing the quantity of clothes he was producing while at the same time increasing their quality, with humming birds, koalas and other animals hidden in the hundreds of hand worked embroidered leaves and flowers of his jungle dresses.The designer has won ethical and sustainability awards for his work supporting local crafts people in rural India.My objective is to create jobs which help people in their own villages, Mishra said.If villages are stronger, you will have a stronger country, a stronger nation, and a stronger world, he added.- Making a stand -Ayissi takes a similar stand, refusing to use wax prints popular in West Africa which he dismisses as colonial.Dutch mills flooded Africa with cotton printed with colourful patterns borrowed from Indonesian batik in the 19th century, and still dominate the market.When we talk about African fashion, its always wax, which is a real pity, he told AFP, because its killing our own African heritage.Ayissi, a former dancer who worked with singers such as Sting and Seal, told AFP he wanted to open up a new path for Africa and find an alternative way of doing luxury fashion.He has gone back to using prestigious local materials, like the strip fabric kente woven by the Akan people of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which was originally worn only by nobles.The son of an undefeated African boxing champ and a former Miss Cameroon, he also uses appliqued techniques from Benin and Ghana.Haute couture shows only take place in Paris and the criteria to enter and remain in fashions elite club are strictly enforced by French law.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

       " 'New Delhi: The Income Tax Department has reiterated that employers must deduct tax at source at 20% or a higher rate if employees fail to disclose their Permanent Account Number (PAN) or Aadhaar number.In a recent circular, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has advised employers that they should procure and quote correct PAN or Aadhaar number of employees in the tax deducted at source (TDS) statements for salaries.According to the Income Tax Act, people earning an income have to furnish their PAN to their employer, failing which a deduction on the taxable income may be made at the applicable rate specified in the Act or is in force or at 20%, whichever is higher.The circular, issued last week while companies prepare their accounts for the financial year end, said employers have to assess tax dues in all scenarios and deduct the highest of all. If the average rate of income tax based on the rates in force is below 20%, the deduction has to be made at the rate of 20%. If the average rate exceeds 20%, tax has to be deducted at the average rate, said the circular. It also said the 4% health and education cess need not be deducted if TDS is done at the rate of 20%. If the income of the employee is below the  2.5 lakh taxable limit, no TDS is required.The reminder from the tax department comes at a time the authorities are trying hard to meet their direct tax collection target despite a sharp reduction in corporate tax rates which is aimed stimulating investments and reviving the economy.Employers try to be meticulous in their TDS obligations as any default on this could invite penalty. The circular reiterated that employers should obtain and quote the tax deduction and collection Account No (TAN) in challans, TDS-certificates, statements and other documents issued. Failure to do so could fetch a fine of  10,000, the circular said. The circular captures the applicable tax rates and surcharges at various income brackets for the convenience of employers.',\n",

       " 'HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam declared a virus emergency on Saturday, announcing measures to limit links with mainland China and prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Flights and high speed rail trips between Hong Kong and Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, will be halted. Schools that are currently on Lunar New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb. 17 and education authorities have asked universities to extend leave for students. Hong Kongs health authorities have confirmed 5 coronavirus cases, all linked to Wuhan, with a further 122 people being treated as suspected of having the disease. Lam said all official visits to the mainland and official Lunar New Year celebrations would be scrapped immediately. But  she rejected calls for a temporary ban on all arrivals from the mainland and said it would be impractical to shut down all border crossings with the mainland. Lam also said she had sought assistance from Chinas State Council to ensure there were adequate supplies of masks. Lam is dealing with the health issue as she faces broader tensions after seven months of sometimes violent anti-government protests. I hereby urge all citizens stay united to fight against the epidemic to protect all Hong Kong peoples health and safety, she said. The demonstrations have centered on Hong Kongs relationship with mainland China: some protesters have railed against growing interference from Beijing while others have expressed concern  over greater integration with the mainland. Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for stirring trouble in the former British colony. Lam, speaking hours after returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos, insisted Saturdays announcement was not delayed due to her trip, saying she had stayed in close touch with officials while in Switzerland. The first case in Hong Kong of the new coronavirus was confirmed on Wednesday, a 39-year-old man visiting from Wuhan who crossed by high-speed rail from neighboring Shenzhen. The condition of one of the people confirmed with the virus deteriorated on Saturday and the patient was now on a respirator, Hong Kongs government funded broadcaster RTHK reported. Hong Kong earlier deployed temperature screening equipment at the airport and the high-speed rail station. Air and train passengers are required to fill in health declaration forms at the border while isolation wards have been set-up in hospitals. Many people are using masks in offices and on public transport, a reflection of the citys strong memories of an earlier coronavirus crisis. Gabriel Leung, the dean of the medical school of Hong Kong University, urged the public to increase its already-substantial wearing of glasses. The short-sighted rate in Hong Kong is the highest in the world. So, mostly everyone has small protection - glasses, he said, urging others to wear glasses too. This is not a perfect measure, but can let you prevent from the droplet transmission to a certain extent, Leung said. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses named because of crown-like spikes on their surfaces. The viruses cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Hong Kong was badly hit by the SARS virus in 2003 and has had many episodes of H5N1 bird flu for more than a decade. According to WHO figures, 1,755 people in Hong Kong contracted the SARS virus at the time and 299 died.

       " 'New York:An American man who wanted to become an executioner for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and fight against India has admitted before a federal judge that he was guilty of providing support to the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation, according to officials.John C. Demers, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, announced that Jesus Wilfrdo Encarnacion, who called himself \"Jihadistsoldgier\" made the admission on Wednesday before Judge Ronnie Abrams at the federal court in Manhattan.\"As he admitted today, Jesus Encarnacion plotted to travel abroad to join and train with the terrorist organization Lashkar e-Tayyiba, infamous worldwide for their brutal jihadist murder of innocent civilians, and to carry out shootings, bombings, and beheadings on their behalf,\" New York federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said.Berman and Demers noted that the LeT is a \"Pakistan-based designated foreign terrorist organization responsible for multiple high-profile attacks, including the infamous Mumbai attacks in November 2008.\"In transcripts of interactions between Encarnacion, an LeT recruiter Michael Kyle Sewell and federal agents that are in court documents IANS has seen, Encarnacion said: \"You guys are against India... you are beefing with India over Muslim land a I hate (expletive) Hindus... They can go to hell. I am going to help you.\"Encarnacion, 30, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at New York\\'s JFK Airport in February when he tried to take a flight to Europe on his way to Pakistan to join the LeT.Admitting guilt in a court, which is formally known as pleading guilty, leads to a conviction and is usually resorted to when the accused faces overwhelming evidence and in return can expect some leniency from prosecutors.At his sentencing scheduled for April, Encarnacion faces a maximum sentence of 20 years for the crime of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation.According to a court document, Encarnacion has described himself as a Dominican. But it was not apparent if he was an immigrant from the Caribbean nation of Dominican Republic or had been born in the US. The document mentioned that he is a new convert to Islam.Sewell, who was 18 when he was arrested in February, has also pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to LeT and was sentenced in September to 20 years by a federal judge in Texas.Sewell was not identified by name in the Encarnacion case but referred to only as a co-conspirator.However, by comparing the court documents in the two cases IANS found similarities in the tracking up by undercover agents and made the connection.A chilling portrait of Encarnacion emerges from the transcripts of interactions between him, Sewell and undercover federal agents.He said: \"I want to fight. I want to execute. I want to behead,\" and pleaded, \"Please. I want to kill on video. Terrify our enemies.\"In a transcript Encarnacion said: \"Kuffar treat me bad\", but does not further identify the \"Kuffar\" or what they did.He initially wanted to join the Islamic State (IS) terrorist organisation, but Sewell directed him to the LeT, presciently predicting the doom of IS.\"There is no point in fighting for them. They have no territory,\" Sewell told him suggesting he join the LeT that has Pakistan\\'s backing.Encarnacion said: \"I hate this country... I can\\'t wait to go to Pakistan.\"',\n",

Before accepting a job with Accenture, a subcontractor that works with several social media companies and manages some YouTube moderators at a Texas facility, employees had to sign a form titled Acknowledgement, the Verge reported.It was introduced days after the Verge published a wide-reaching investigation into the epidemic of PTSD among workers at the facility and told workers they must acknowledge that It is possible that reviewing such content may impact my mental health, and it could even lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).A spokesman for Accenture told the Guardian it has long required new employees to sign these kinds of documents. The latest contract was given to new employees and reissued to existing employees, but a spokesman there are no consequences for not signing the reissued document.The wellbeing of our people is a top priority, the Accenture spokesman said. We regularly update the information we give our people to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the work they do.The contract was not sent at the direction of YouTubes parent company Google, a spokesman from YouTube told the Guardian, but was an Accenture employment document.Moderators do vital and necessary work to keep digital platforms safer for everyone, the YouTube spokesman said. We choose the companies we partner with carefully and require them to provide comprehensive resources to support moderators wellbeing and mental health.YouTube is not the only platform facing these workplace hazards. Many of the thousands of contract workers who moderate content for Facebook have reported harmful psychological effects from viewing graphic content on a daily basis, a September 2019 report from the Guardian found.A Facebook spokesman told the Guardian it does not have a hand in such contracts distributed by Accenture, and that its partner contracts mandate only pay and benefits.In February, the Verge published one of the first behind-the-scenes reports from a US Facebook contractor where employees reported the conspiracy videos and memes that they see each day gradually led them to embrace fringe views, and that a former moderator now sleeps with a gun at his side.A Twitter spokesman told the Guardian that both full-time and contract Twitter employees receive information in their onboarding that acknowledges they may potentially come into contact with sensitive material.Its the nature of the work we do to ensure healthy conversation on our service, the spokesman said.

       " 'Terming his participation in the recently held World Economic Forum (WEF) as the cheapest official visit, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan disclosed that his trip was sponsored by two of his friends and well-known businessmen Ikram Sehgal and Imran Chaudhry, it was reported on Saturday.Addressing the Breakfast at Davos, an event jointly organised by Pathfinder Group and Martin Dow Group on Thursday, Khan said his trip cost 10 times less than those of the previous leaders, Dawn news said in a report.He recalled that his trip to the UN General Assembly last November was the least costly with $160,000 as compared to former President Asif Zardaris $1.4 million expenditure, former premier Nawaz Sharifs $1.3 million and even $800,000 of former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.Thanking Sehgal, a retired military officer and chairman of the Pathfinder Group, Khan said: He is instrumental in getting me here. Otherwise, I would not have burdened my government to pay a sum of $450,000 for two nights.It is perhaps the first time that the expenses of a Prime Ministers official travel have been covered by private citizens or businessmen.Reiterating that this was an austerity programme, Khan said the government should rely on the over nine million Pakistanis residing overseas. The GDP of those nine million overseas Pakistanis in my opinion is almost 50 per cent of Pakistans (overall) GDP of 200 million people. So we can use this resource and they can sponsor these things, he said.The premier said he had also stopped his ministers from going on junkets, Dawn news reported. Whenever they say they want to go somewhere, I immediately cancel the trip until they convince me that it will be productive for the country. I dont allow them to go anywhere, he said.To be able to attend the WEF annual meeting, a person has to be invited - in which case the event is free - or has to be a member of the Forum.A membership of the WEF costs about $60,000 to $600,000, plus an additional fee needed to acquire an attendance badge, which runs about $27,000 per person to get into the conference.',\n",
       " 'On a lazy winter afternoon, Shraddha Kapoor, in a no-makeup-look, curls up on a sofa in a plush hotel in Mumbai and apologises for being late by approximately 15 minutes. As she settles in and is asked to share her earliest memories with her Street Dancer 3D co-star Varun Dhawan, nostalgia hits her. She says, Varun and I were in rival schools. When youre growing up, if youre in one school and your friend is in another school, your conversations are mostly about how your school is better than theirs. This has happened throughout our childhood. Smiling, she adds, Varun has a very special place in my life and in my heart. Ive grown up knowing him. When youre working with someone youve a special bond with, it becomes a very special experience. He has been the same person and thats one of the most amazing qualities that he has. Hes so down-to-earth and is very approachable.So what are her thoughts on the actor that Varun is? Hes a peoples person and it comes very naturally to him. He has maintained that quality. Everybody loves him. Hes got a spark which makes the masses feel that he belongs to them. Its so amazing to watch him on the big screen, she shares. Shraddha says that both ABCD 2 (2015) and Street Dancer 3D are important films for her. They are trendsetters. ABCD 2 helped me fulfil another childhood dream of mine, that of dancing on the big screen. Street Dancer 3D, along with ABCD 2, required me to do professional-level dancing and explore different styles of dance that Remo (Dsouza; choreographer-director) sir brought to India.Also read: Street Dancer 3D movie review: Varun Dhawan-Shraddha Kapoor film has thinner plot than a dance reality showShraddha says that the compliments surrounding her dance movies come across as a surprise to her. She reveals that she gets a panic attack every time she needs to pick up a choreography set. A plethora of questions keeps popping in my head  Will I be able to do it? How long do I have to pick the set up? Will it be a one-take shot? Will we shoot it indoors or outdoors? What should I wear? This is followed by my team calming me down and then we approach the entire process by taking one step at a time. As you start rehearsing, you realise that some of the steps are way more difficult than the others and what they looked like. So, you strengthen your body, chart out a workout plan, set your diet, hydrate yourself and change your sleeping pattern according to that, she elaborates. Rewinding to her childhood days, she says, I realised I love dancing from the moment I learnt to walk. My parents used to make my brother and I dance at home. Back in those days, there were no handy cams and so, they used to set up big cameras in a way so that we couldnt see them. Then they used to play I Love You from Maha-Sangram (1990) and other songs of Sridevi and Madhuri (Dixit Nene). I used to be crazy about them. My parents knew that if they played these songs, both of us would come before the mirror and start dancing. Weve still those footages at home (laughs). Follow @htshowbiz for more',\n",
       " \"She came. She struggled. She feels she is still evolving. Kubbra Sait, an extremely confident actress who is steadily scurring all her way to the top is totally winning hearts. She surely knows how to make her presence felt on the screen and that is clearly visible in the work that she does. But success didnt come easy to her. She challenged herself every day, fell in love with herself all over again, accepted the hits as much as the misses and voila,astunner was born.Kubbra will soon be sharing screen space with Saif Ali Khan in Jawaani Jaaneman and is playing the actors friend. In an exclusive interview with Zoom Digital, she bared it all out about working with the actor. She says,I hadnever met him until I went on set. What I got to know much later was that he recommended me for this part. So I was really excited to work with him on this film and then I got to know this and I was like 'Oh, now this pressure! But then I think I perform well under pressure, so let's see what I have done with it. But Saif as a human being and as a co-actor and someone who has been in this industry for like donkey's years and has been reinventing himself time and again, is so fun to work with because he is so free with compliments. He doesn't hold things back. When you like somebody's work, you appreciate. When you can boost someone's confidence and you won't be afraid to do that and that is what good camaraderie is all about. I really appreciate him for that. He is all always front-foot and kind to people and that's what I like the most about him.Speaking about her character in the film and playing the protagonists friend, she stated,It is a super-fun role. She is young, a secret keeper of the character of Saif. There is this beautiful energy being shared between the two characters in the film (Saif and Kubbra). It is lovely! What I like the most about itis the fact that in the '90s when the films were being made and if you were the hero's friend, then you would be typecast as the hero's friend for the rest of your life. But thankfully, times have changed now and even the hero's friend has so many shades to play. And that is what is beautiful about the scripts that are being written today. For me, it was just elevating to play a character where there is this lovely attraction and distance, self-reservation and fun, about accepting somebody's flaws for who they are and just accepting it and knowing that they are your friend, and you accept them for who they are and that is a fun thing to do. I am a champion of love, I call myself champion of love.Kubbra then went on to shareif she ever regretted not taking up a certain role that she was offered. She also talked aboutnot having a godfather in this industry:No, whatever work I got, I did. I have never said no to a role till today. I have only done it because of merekopata nahi hai agar mere ko kal role milega ya nahin. For example, in retrospect, I could have said no to the role of a maid. I know people who told me I shouldn't play. I was like 'are you kidding me?' I am getting a film opposite Salman Khan! I am doing this because I don't have a godfather. I don't know where to get another opportunity or how to create another opportunity. The opportunity that I have is what I need to make and that is what I did. So I haven't said no to any role and I don't have any regrets.The film is slated to release on January 31.\",\n",
       " \"Roger Federer survived a thrilling five-set encounter against Australias John Millman in round 3 of Australian Open on Friday. The 20-time Grand Slam Champion eventually came out the winner after a tie-breaker in the final set, and advanced to the fourth round with a 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 4-6 7-6 (10-8) win. But despite the strong fight, his Australian opponent John Millman was accused of ball tampering during the clash. Maria Sharapovas former coach Sven Groeneveld, in a tweet, pointed out that Millman was captured rubbing two tennis balls on his wet t-shirt, which could help in speeding up the serve after it hits the ground. https://t.co/r3hhmjM09I pic.twitter.com/805VAxRFcrIn a tweet, he wrote: Millman applying the old trick in speeding up the first serve by rolling the ball on his (I assume) wet shirt before he serves? Is that legal in tennis I know its not in other ball sports like cricket and baseball? Do we have a rule in tennis?As per USTA rules, a player may not take any action that materially changes the condition of the ball. Therefore, a player may not use a ball to wipe off perspiration. But no such clause has been pointed out by ITF.Aussies ball tampering? The very idea!If it's true no surprise for me as Aussies are known for thatBall tampering & Aussies ?1987 Wimbledon Champion Pat Cash came to Millmans defence saying the sweat has barely any effect on the ball. Its absolute c**p. Rubbing the ball on a sweaty shirt has very little effect on the ball, if any effect all. Its more to smooth the cover of the ball down. It becomes a habit for some players. John Newcombe and lots of our great champions used to do back in the day when the ball quality probably wasnt as good, he told Daily Telegraph.How does that affect anything? Its crap. Cricketers are allowed to use sweat and saliva on the ball to help it swing. Thats legal. Using sweat on a tennis ball does virtually nothing. It might make it fractionally heavier but it would have no impact on the receiver. Its b--lshit, he added.Federer will next face off against Hungarian star Mrton Fucsovics in the fourth round on Sunday.\",\n",
       " 'The Guardian has learned the true identity of the leader and founder of the US-based neo-Nazi terror network the Base, which was recently the target of raids by the FBI after an investigation into domestic terrorism uncovered their plans to start a race war.Members of the group stand accused of federal hate crimes, murder plots and firearms offenses, and have harbored international fugitives in recent months.The Bases leader previously operated under the aliases Norman Spear and Roman Wolf. Members of the network do not know his true identity due to the groups culture of internal secrecy.But the Guardian can reveal that Norman Spear is in fact US-born Rinaldo Nazzaro, 46, who has a long history of advertising his services as an intelligence, military and security contractor. He has claimed, under his alias, to have served in Russia and Afghanistan.The revelation of his identity comes after a months-long investigation by the Guardian into Nazzaro and the activities of the Base.While Nazzaros most recently used address is in New Jersey, there is evidence supporting his claims of being based in Russia, where he lives with his Russian wife.The Base  which is an approximate English translation of al-Qaida  began recruiting in late 2018. The white supremacy group, which has regional and international cells, extols the virtues of an all-out race war while specifically targeting African Americans and Jewish people.Using encrypted apps, members of the highly organized group planned terror campaigns; vandalized synagogues; established armed training camps and recruited new members.The US attorney for Maryland, Robert K Hur, speaking after the recent arrest of three members of the Base, said that they did more than talk  they took steps to act and act violently on their racist views.Rinaldo Nazzaro has maintained a decidedly low profile: he has no visible presence on any major social media platforms, no published writings under his own name, and no profile in local or national media.Few traces of him exist anywhere, except where a name is required in official business  such as real estate purchases and the registration of companies.Multiple emails and phone calls to Nazzaro went unanswered.But through a painstaking investigation involving freedom of information requests, the analysis of material provided to the Guardian by a whistleblower inside the group, and cross-examination of information found online and in databases, the Guardian was able to piece together his identity and some of his whereabouts.The Guardian was able to unravel Nazzaros identity due to his 2018 activities in a remote corner of the Pacific north-west.In chat rooms hosted by the Base, Nazzaro stressed the importance of in-person meet-ups and required members to attend training camps. The Bases propaganda videos show young men undergoing combat training together in rural areas.Last August, an Oregon-based antifascist group, Eugene Antifa, warned that the Base was planning a hate camp in the neighboring state of Washington, and claimed Nazzaro (operating under the alias of Spear) had purchased land in Stevens county for training purposes. This warning came after a leak of the Bases internal chats.The neo-Nazi group called \"The Base\" is planning a \\'hate camp\\' this month in Washington. Members are flying in from around the country to Spokane, WA this August to participate in the gathering.#DeBasedDoxx [THREAD] pic.twitter.com/L7M59zoaYnLocal media outlets picked up the story, which led local law enforcement to urgently seek information on the group.In emails obtained by the Guardian via public records request, the Stevens county Sheriff, Brad Manke, is seen contacting the FBI and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for advice on the group.On 20 August 2019, Manke writes to an FBI agent, asking: Do you have a name for the actual head of the group The Base or the address where the property actually is?In a 20 September email responding to an SPLC researcher, Manke writes: I have since learned that The Base has purchased property in Ferry County, WA which is a neighboring county.Property record searches revealed that three 10-acre blocks of undeveloped land were purchased in December 2018 for $33,000 in the name of a Delaware LLC called Base Global. In a telephone conversation in late November, Manke confirmed that this was the block of land he had been referring to.In recordings of two internal Base voice calls provided to the Guardian by the source, Norman Spear discusses his recent land purchase.When asked why the land had been inexpensive, he replied: Because theres no possibility of getting utilities in there. Ever. He continued: But to me, that was a good thing for my purposes. I looked at it like it was just naturally secluded.In deeds of sale, the address provided for the company was a New Jersey post office  enough to conceal the purchasers identity. But separate tax affidavits associated with the purchase give a different address for Base Global.That address is for a New Jersey apartment that has belonged to an older family member of Nazzaro since 1998. Nazzaro and his wife have also intermittently resided at that address, according to database searches.The affidavits are also signed by Nazzaro, and dated 12/21/2018 Republic. Republic is the seat and the only city in Ferry county, Washington.According to a source inside the Base, this date coincided with a trip by Russia-based Norman Spear to the United States, during which time he had in-person meetings with members of the group.The location of the land is consistent with Norman Spears advocacy of a white supremacist strategy called the Northwest Territorial Imperative (NTI), which was promoted by the deceased white supremacist Harold Covington.The strategy argues for the creation of a separatist ethnostate in the Pacific north-west and encourages white supremacists to move to the region.In one of Norman Spears first public appearances, on a far-right podcast recorded in December 2017, he was introduced as a Northwest Front (another white supremacist separatist group) organizer and went on to spell out a four-state plan culminating in achieving independence, realizing the ultimate goal which is an independent nation state in the Pacific north-west, an ethnostate.The plan, he said, would trigger the relocation to the Pacific north-west of the white population in the United States.Around the same time, Spear filmed a series of short instructional presentations on the tactics and strategy of guerrilla warfare. In an archive of those videos on the site Bitchute, which hosts a large amount of far-right content, he is identified as Defense Studies expert and former CIA field intelligence officer Norman Spear.This detail, coupled with other leads, compelled many to speculate whether Norman Spear was, in fact, a federal agent operating inside the Base.The Base has emerged at a time when far-right organizing is on the rise in the US. Last year saw a spate of terror attacks by white supremacists. In August, the gunman who killed 22 people at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, is believed to have posted a white nationalist manifesto online prior to the attack.In April, an attacker who killed one person after opening fire inside a San Diego synagogue killing posted a note online citing white supremacy influences and naming the gunman who killed 51 in an attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, as an inspiration.We have a significant increase in racially motivated violent extremism in the United States and, I think, a growing increase in white nationalism and white supremacy extremist movements, Jay Tabb, the head of national security for the FBI, said at an event in Washington recently.Under the motto there is no political solution, the Base embraces an accelerationist ideology, which holds that acts of violence and terror are required in order to push liberal democracy towards collapse, preparing the way for white supremacists to seize power and institute an ethnostate.Members remained defiant following the arrest of seven alleged members of the group in mid-January, calling it an unjust political witch hunt from the Liberal Globalist System.Beginning in 2009 and until as late as 2019, Nazzaro billed himself as an intelligence expert working with various government and military agencies.Nazzaro is the principal of an LLC called Omega Solutions International (OSI), a company offering a range of intelligence and security contracting.Its website, which was removed from the Internet some time after August 2019, boasted of the firms experience conducting intelligence analysis for government agencies, military organizations, and private businesses, as well as access to a network of seasoned security professionals with expertise in counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, homeland security, hostage rescue/negotiations, psychological operations, and more.The firm also has a Cage Code, which is an administrative requirement for military and government contractors.Materials inspected and sources consulted by the Guardian indicate that Nazzaro, as Spear, has faced persistent suspicions from current and former members of the group that he is a fed, or the agent of a foreign government, or that the Base is a honeypot intended to lure neo-Nazis out into the open for the benefit of law enforcement agencies.Former members have cited this as a reason for leaving.New York marriage records show that Nazzaro and his wife were married in New York City in 2012, during the period when Nazzaro is recorded as maintaining a midtown Manhattan address. At that time, he was recorded as having one child.A Russian site that scrapes and archives social media accounts had captured a profile, and photos, posted by Nazzaros Russian-born wife to VK, the Russian social media site.She has since hidden that profile, but other social media archives confirm the prior existence of an account in Nazzaros wifes name (using her married name).The photographs show the same person who has been presenting himself as Norman Spear.Meanwhile, a reverse image search yielded a photograph matching public photos of Norman Spear atop advertisements for English lessons in St Petersburg, Russia.The Guardian was only able to find one earlier photograph attached to his real name. It appeared above a vox pop in the Villanovan, the student paper of Catholic, Pennsylvania-based Villanova University, in 1994.At the time of the photograph, Ron Nazzaro was described as a junior in philosophy, which is consistent with a 1973 birthdate. A source who has met Spear in person believes that the 1994 photo of Nazzaro is the same person he met.A Rinaldo Nazzaro is also identified as a class of 1991 alumnus and donor of the prestigious New Jersey Catholic prep school the Delbarton School.Nazzaros approximate age, his Italian heritage, his familys New Jersey location, his background in counter-intelligence, the nationality of his spouse, and the number of his children were relayed to the Guardian as characteristics of Norman Spear by an internally placed source.Richard Tobin, a Base member, is awaiting trial in New Jersey over allegations that he coordinated the September vandalism of synagogues in Michigan and Wisconsin. In a December custody hearing, the prosecuting assistant US attorney cited Tobins self-professed belief that Norman Spear was a Russian spy.The Guardian has discovered that all of the business addresses associated with Nazzaros OSI LLCs are virtual offices. This describes a situation where a second company provides a business address, and sometimes meeting rooms and greeting services, for businesses who do not wish to maintain their own premises.The addresses are often prestigious: OSIs virtual address locations include Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and K Street in Washington DC, an address associated with federal government contracting and lobbying.Meanwhile, Norman Spear appears to have had no extended history in the neo-Nazi movement before emerging as leader of the Base.According to an internally placed source, the only people within the movement who vouched for Spear were connected to the Northwest Front (NWF). The NWF founder, Harold Covington, was himself the subject of persistent rumors within the white nationalist movement that he was a federal informant, and that NWF was itself a honeypot  a front organization routinely used by US law enforcement in order to entrap people.Norman Spear has told Base members that he remains in Russia. Law enforcement sources have indicated on background that Nazzaro is believed by some agencies to be working for the Russian government.The US government may have been monitoring Norman Spears activities for some time. In the April conversation planning a meetup in July, Spear was concerned that he would not be able to attend.I have confirmed that I am on the FBI terrorism watch list. I mean, that doesnt really matter in the context of the training. What matters is that Im on it.The Guardians investigation of the group continues.',\n",

In support of the National Day of Racial Healing, the singer spoke with People magazine about his personal experiences about discrimination. John said: Im in a position of privilege and celebrity and all these other things, so theres a lot of doors that open for me that arent open for other people. People recognise me and treat me a certain way because they recognise me. Im clear that my life now is not the experience of the average black man. Im fully aware of that.He said the hardest time for him was when he was at the University of Pennsylvania as one of the things he noticed about the college was how people treat one as an outsider around campus if they arent aware that youre a student.Also read: Street Dancer 3D movie review: Varun Dhawan-Shraddha Kapoor film has thinner plot than a dance reality showI had several interactions with the police where they questioned my right to even be where I was, to get in my own car ... So that was where I felt it the most in west Philadelphia around the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, being treated like I didnt belong there because I was black. No one ever says it. But its obvious that they dont do white students like that and ask for their ID just to get in their own car and question their belonging, he added.And while it has been some time since the singer attended the university, his younger cousin is still dealing with the same problems there. Legend said: Someone called the police on her just for existing in a building where the person didnt think that she belonged. Its not unique to UPenn. You see these stories all over the internet, and people experience them all the time. Black people and other people of colour have to prove that they belong in circumstances that other people dont.However, he has begun to educate himself on the issues at an early age as he understood that there were certain challenges that black people had in society.But in the end, it is his culture that makes John the artist he is today.

       " ' A Gurugram police constable was booked for allegedly accessing her husbands call records illegally, the police said on Friday, adding that a case was registered against her on the direction of a local court on Thursday.According to the police, a bank manager, who works in Sector 31, and his wife, a police constable, are having a marital discord and are engaged in multiple litigations against one another. The woman is alleged to have misused her position as police to surveil and record her husbands phone calls. The woman is also alleged to have forged the signature of her superior officers as well, along with two of her colleagues. The husband, becoming suspicious after she allegedly started discussing issues he had privately talked about with his friends, filed a right to information (RTI) query and learned that his mobile phone was on surveillance. He then approached the police and court.Taking cognizance of the complaint filed by Rajesh Kumar (35), judicial magistrate Sumitra Kadian directed the filing of an FIR against Savita Kumari, a resident of Bhondsi, and two of her colleagues.I was posted as a manager in Saharanpur of Uttar Pradesh and currently, posted as a manager in the city, holding a position of dealing with the transportation and management of huge cases on a daily basis. Such a job requires the utmost secrecy and confidentiality. In case the information about the movement, timing and the quantum of cash transfer is leaked, it may cause irreparable loss to the exchequer and may result in loss of lives, said Kumar, highlighting how his phone recording could have had led to a financial loss to the bank.In August 2017, Kumar received a call from one his friends informing that his estranged wife had called him and was asking why they were talking frequently, the police said.The suspect is also alleged to have called the mans cousin on October 6, 2017, advising him not to accompany Kumar to a panchayat in Ranila village. The panchayat was called to settle the dispute between the two. I was shocked how my wife came to know that I had requested my cousin to accompany me to the panchayat, he said.He then filed an RTI with his telecom company, seeking details about his own number.In March 2018, Rajesh filed a complaint with the commissioner of police seeking action against his wife for tracking his phone. An inquiry was conducted in which my statement was also recorded. The accused were found guilty of illegally surveilling my phone, said Kumar.That these facts itself clarifies that all the accused in conspiracy with each other and being public servants and by misusing their post have disobeyed the law with intent to cause injury to the complainant, have knowingly disobeyed the direction of law, the court observed.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that a case was registered on Thursday at Badshahpur police station under sections 166 (whoever, being a public servant, knowingly disobeys any direction of the law), 167 (public servant preparing false document), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating), 464 (making a false document), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document), 500 (defamation), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and sections 66 and 82 of the IT Act.',\n",
       " 'The Scotland Yard on Friday formally identified the three men killed in a stabbing incident in east London last week as Indian nationals who were living in the area.Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Specialist Crime Command said the men killed were 29-year-old Narinder Singh Lubhaya, 30-year-old Harinder Kumar and 37-year-old Malkit Singh Dhillon alias Baljinder Singh.   They were found with serious stab wounds by emergency services and pronounced dead at the scene in Seven Kings area of Redbridge in Ilford last Sunday.   The Indian High Commission in London said it will provide the victims families every assistance in relation to the repatriation of their bodies to India.All the three men were living in the Ilford area and were Indian nationals. Their next of kin have all been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers, the Met Police said.The force said 29-year-old Gurjeet Singh, arrested in connection with the case, has been remanded in custody to appear at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 19 February after being charged with possessing an offensive weapon in a public place this week.   While he remains under investigation in connection with the murders, a second man arrested as part of the murder investigation has since been eliminated from police enquiries.I know that people were present when the attack occurred, I urge them to come forward. This is a dreadful incident that has shocked the local community. I need their help to piece together exactly what happened and the events that led up to it, said Detective Chief Inspector Paul Considine, who is leading the investigation.The Met Police has reiterated that they do not believe the fatal incident was gang-related as their enquiries around the motive behind the killings remain ongoing.Officers at this stage are not seeking to make any further arrests for murder, the police said.Earlier, it had been indicated that the three men may have been killed as a result of an ongoing dispute involving the local Sikh and Hindu communities. All the men involved worked as local builders in the area and the dispute is feared to have escalated over the issue of non-payment for some building work.The incident sent shockwaves across the city, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan visiting the site and calling for more government resources to tackle knife crime on the streets of London.   Jas Athwal, the British Sikh leader of the local Redbridge Council of the area, stressed that the isolated incident must not tarnish the reputation of an otherwise peaceful community.The Redbridge community coming together to remember the deceased and pray for a better tomorrow, hoping for an end to the violence that has cut short too many lives too many times, he said, following a vigil in the area earlier this week.Community groups have also spoken out against some of the coverage of the fatal incident in the UK press.From what we know it was a personal fight that got out of hand. We would urge the media not to sensationalise it as any gang or drugs related matter, said a spokesperson for the Singh Sabha London East, which led an ardaas (prayer) in memory of the deceased during the vigil.',\n",
       " 'It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Chinas national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 13 February there are now just under 60,000 confirmed cases and 1,380 deaths in mainland China. A change in the way the metrics were calculated has lead to a large jump in the number of acknowledged cases.There are cases in 28 other countries outside China, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.There are nine cases of the virus in the UK. Four were located in Brighton, one in London. At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative. Of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.We dont yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we wont know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.Another key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population  elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems  to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.Anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last two weeks and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath should stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild, the NHS advises.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is the worldwide spread of a disease. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHOs list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a window of opportunity to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.',\n",
       " 'Disha Patani is set to star opposite Salman Khan in Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai and the actor says she is looking forward to the project which marks their second collaboration after Bharat. Disha said Salman offered her the film and she decided to do it as it also gave her an opportunity to work with filmmaker-choreographer Prabhu Dheva.Salman sir just asked me if I would like to do the film. I said yes. There is a reason why I chose to do the film, besides the fact that it had Salman sir and it was directed by Prabhu Dheva sir. It has to do with the story and my character, Disha told PTI. In Ali Abbas Zafars Bharat, Disha played young Salmans love interest. Their on-screen chemistry and song Slow Motion was a hit.Disha said, while she enjoys acting opposite Salman, she finds his aura intimidating.  He is a star. He has this aura around him. But he is very sweet. I respect him a lot. I am still intimidated working with him. During Bharat I was not intimidated on-screen but off-screen I was. In my mind I was. But you have to keep everything aside when the director says action, after the cut I was intimidated again, she added.

       " 'I strongly suspect that of all the Khans currently working in Bollywood, Saif is having the most fun. You can see the glee in his delicious rendition of the psychopath Udaybhan in Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior. He hungrily chews on crocodile meat and lustily inhales the scent of a woman he has kidnapped but whom he wont rape because he wants her love  hes sensitive like that. Three months ago, Saif was playing a murderous Naga Sadhu in Lal Kaptaan. Next month, he will return to his trademark role of urbane party boy in Jawaani Jaaneman. He even recreates his own 1994 hit song, Ole Ole, from Yeh Dillagi. In the trailer, when his daughter in the film asks who else lives with him, he replies: Bas ji, main aur mera swag. Its perfect.Saifs choices reveal an actor unafraid of outcomes. He is an artist unconcerned with image, public perception and, most importantly, box office. There is no longer any pressure on him to deliver an opening  Chef (2017) opened to a little over Rs 1 crore; Lal Kaptaan (2019) did even worse, with around Rs 50 lakh. He is an A-list star without bottom line commitments, which clearly has been incredibly liberating creatively.Its allowed him to jump on the streaming bandwagon with Sacred Games before any other A-list star. And to do films like the cheerfully trippy Kaalakaandi (2017), in which he plays a man who is told he has terminal cancer and decides, as a result, that he isnt following the rules anymore. He drops acid and, in one scene, insists that a transgender prostitute show him her southern hemisphere.Amitabh Bachchan experienced a similar creative spring in the early years of the new millennium. After Mohabbatein (2000), he shed the burden of being a leading man and explored roles that would have been unthinkable in his heyday, in films like Aks (2001), Black (2005), Sarkar (2005), Nishabd (2007) and even the unwatchable Boom (2003). Which makes me wonder, why dont female artists exhibit the same kind of creative recklessness? Why dont actresses who are no longer in the leading lady rat race, throw caution to the winds and experiment with edgier content, new directors and narratives that allow them to fully explore their talent?Take Madhuri Dixit: gorgeous, supremely talented, but last seen playing Bahaar Begum in Kalank (essentially a bargain basement version of Chandramukhi in Devdas). Are filmmakers not creating meatier roles for her? Or is she sticking to the straight and narrow because her riskier ventures (Dedh Ishqiya, Gulaab Gang) didnt pay off? Juhi Chawla, as a despicable politician, was one of the best things in Gulaab Gang, but we rarely see her onscreen at all. Kajol seems stuck in half-baked stories like Helicopter Eela (2018) and Dilwale (2015). Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was last seen in a cameo in Fanney Khan (2018). Karishma Kapoor hasnt done a film since Dangerous Ishhq (2012) and we havent seen Sushmita Sen since Nirbaak in 2015 (though she is currently shooting a web series with Chandrachur Singh).If films cant accommodate these artists, perhaps streaming shows can. In the OTT space, your career isnt defined by your Friday. Freedom is built into the medium. And it would be thrilling to watch these women soar.',\n",

       " \"(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday confirmed a second U.S. case of the new coronavirus from China in a Chicago woman, and said as many as 63 potential cases were being investigated as the sometimes deadly illness continues to spread around the globe. Of the 63 people under investigation from 22 states, 11 have so far tested negative, CDC said on a conference call with reporters. News of the woman in Chicago infected with the virus that originated in Wuhan, China, followed the announcement earlier this week of a man from Washington state who was diagnosed with the virus after returning from Wuhan. The newly discovered virus has killed 26 people and infected more than 800. Most of the cases and all of the deaths so far have been in China, where officials have imposed severe restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The virus has created alarm, but there are a still many unknowns surrounding it, such as just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can lead to pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. CDC believes the immediate risk to the American public is low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDCs Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on the call. More U.S. cases are likely, she added. Dr. Julie Gerberding, a Merck & Co executive who was CDC director during the 2003 SARS outbreak, said it is too early to predict the course the disease. I would caution against jumping to any premature conclusions about the severity of this because the epidemic is still unfolding, she said in a phone interview. As we learn from basically every new outbreak, we dont know where its going to end up until it gets there. The 60-year-old woman from Chicago had traveled to Wuhan in December and returned Jan. 13.  Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said on a conference call that the woman is in stable condition and remains in an unnamed Chicago hospital primarily for infection control purposes.  She had not taken public transportation and was not ill when she traveled, Arwady said. A few days after arriving home, the patient began to feel unwell and called ahead to alert her doctor to her illness. The physician asked about her travel history, quickly put a mask on the patient, and directed her to a hospital with infection control capabilities, Arwady said. Hospital staff performed a full clinical examination and worked with public health officials to arrange testing for the novel coronavirus at the CDC. Dr. Michael Ison, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, which is not caring for the patient, said the announcement of the second U.S. case means the system is working. I dont think the severity of the threat has changed, he said. In a local news briefing, Arwady said the health risk to Chicago residents remains low, adding there is no need for people to change their behavior in any way. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the virus an emergency in China, but stopped short of declaring it a global health emergency.

       " 'Jordan Belfort, the former stockbroker whose story inspired the Martin Scorsese-directed hit The Wolf of Wall Street, is suing the films financiers for fraud and breach of contract, and claiming $300m in compensation.According to the Hollywood Reporter, Belforts legal action arises directly from the financial scandal surrounding Red Granite, the production company that put up the films $100m budget but was subsequently linked to a multimillion-dollar embezzlement in which huge sums were siphoned from 1MDB, a Malaysian state fund. Riza Aziz, Red Granites co-founder and stepson of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, is currently under arrest in Malaysia on money laundering charges.Belforts lawyer told the website: Red Granite and its principals did not disclose to Mr Belfort that they were using funds obtained from engaging in racketeering and other criminal activity  Had Mr Belfort known those facts, he would have never agreed to enter into this contract.In effect, Belfort is attempting to cancel the contract with Red Granite, in which he signed over the rights to make a film from his book. Belforts legal complaint claims that the investigations into Red Granite are preventing Belfort from setting up a sequel or follow-up film. Belfort is significantly damaged by Red Granites tainting of his book/story rights, coupled with Red Granites inability and/or refusal to exploit and maximise the rights acquired from Belfort  due to the highly publicised scandal.In response, Red Granites lawyer told the Hollywood Reporter: Jordan Belforts lawsuit is nothing more than a desperate and supremely ironic attempt to get out from under an agreement that for the first time in his life made him rich and famous through lawful and legitimate means.Belforts memoir, The Wolf of Wall Street, was published in 2007 after Belfort served 22 months in jail for securities fraud relating to his activities in the 1980s and 90s with his brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont, and for which he was ordered to pay back more than $110m to his customers. A second memoir, Catching the Wolf of Wall Street, was published in 2009.Scorseses film starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort and was released in 2013. It was nominated for five Oscars and remains Scorseses most successful film at the global box office.',\n",

       " 'A senior manager at a Portuguese bank co-owned by Isabel dos Santos, the Angolan businesswoman at the centre of the Luanda Leaks scandal, has been found dead in Lisbon.The death of Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, 45, was confirmed by police hours after the banker was named alongside Dos Santos and three other individuals as a suspect in a criminal investigation in Angola into alleged embezzlement at the state oil company, Sonangol.The national director of Portugals judicial police, Luis Neves, said preliminary reports indicated Ribeiro da Cunhas death was suicide and that nobody else was involved. He told reporters his staff were prepared to help with the Angolan corruption investigation whenever a formal request is made.The banker held a senior role at EuroBic, a privatelyowned lender whose largest shareholder is Dos Santos. He appears to have handled a number of transactions for companies controlled by Dos Santos, according to leaked files.Dos Santos, the daughter of Angolas former president, Jos Eduardo dos Santos, has faced intense pressure this week after the Guardian and other media published stories based on the Luanda Leaks, a cache of 715,000 papers from the heart of her business empire.The documents, passed to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), reveals the complex financial schemes that helped Africas richest woman amass a fortune at vast cost to the Angolan state.Dos Santos denies accusations of nepotism and corruption and insists that her estimated $2.2bn (1.7bn) fortune  which makes her the richest woman in Africa  is the result of legitimate business and says she is the victim of a politically-motivated witch-hunt by the new Angolan president.Dos Santos issued further denials on Thursday, after it emerged she had been named as a criminal suspect in Angola, claiming the rule of law has been undermined in Angola where the courts are subject to political pressure.The allegations which have been made against me over the last few days are extremely misleading and untrue, she said. This is a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year.She added: I am a private businesswoman who has spent 20 years building successful companies from the ground up, creating over 20,000 jobs and generating huge tax revenue for Angola. I have always operated within the law and all my commercial transactions have been approved by lawyers, banks, auditors and regulators.One of those auditors, the accountancy firm PwC, has terminated all work for entities controlled by the Dos Santos family, and initiated an investigation. The global chairman of PwC, Bob Moritz, told the Guardian heads could roll at his company. Well wait for the investigation, I dont want to rush, he said earlier this week. But we need to move with speed to take action to regain confidence.On Thursday, Angolas attorney general, Heldr Pitta Grs, travelled to Lisbon to discuss the Dos Santos case with his Portuguese counterpart, Lucilia Gago.The Angolan criminal investigation by government prosecutors is focusing on the period Dos Santos spent at the helm of Sonangol. The state oil company accounts for 90% of exports in a country where millions live below the poverty line, earning less than $2 a day.Isabel dos Santos is accused of mismanagement and embezzlement of funds during her tenure at Sonangol, Pitta Grs said at a press conference on Wednesday evening.He named four other individuals as suspects. They included Ribeiro da Cunha  the director of private banking at EuroBic who was found dead.Earlier this week EuroBic announced that it had barred Dos Santos and her family as customers. On Wednesday it confirmed she had agreed to sell her 42.5% shareholding.The Angolan authorities said they will now conduct a criminal investigation to determine whether Dos Santos and the other suspects should be formally charged. All those concerned will be notified of their status as defendants and asked to voluntarily return to Angola, said Pitta Grs.He added international arrest warrants could he issued for those who do not come of their own accord.In her statement, Dos Santos said stolen documents had been leaked selectively to give a false impression of my business activities. She added: It is an attempt to neutralise me and to discredit the legacy of president dos Santos and his family.

       " 'Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh on Friday evening ordered Delhi Police to file a case against Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra after a huge row over his India vs Pak tweets that the Election Commission concluded appeal to communal feelings.Ranbir Singh, who is the Election Commissions point person for the Delhi assembly elections, told the police to register the case under Section 123 of the Representation of Peoples Act that governs the conduct of elections. Section 123 of this law relates to corrupt practices in elections and bars people from promoting hatred between communities to affect the election.Kapil Mishra, who was a minister in the outgoing Arvind Kejriwal government before a bitter falling out with Aam Aadmi Party leaders, had crossed over to the BJP and is the partys candidate from Model Town.Mishra had triggered a political firestorm yesterday with a string of tweets that compared the February 8 election to a India vs Pakistan clash. In his other tweets and public statements that followed, Kapil Mishra had claimed that mini-Pakistans were being created in Delhi and alleged that Pakistani rioters are occupying the roads.The Model Town returning officer sent him a show-cause notice for his tweets last evening. As election officials waited for his formal reply, they also sent out a quick message to Twitter to take down his tweet that appeared to be designed to appeal to communal feelings.Mishras explanation - besides claiming that Pakistans proxies were likely to be present at Shaheen Bagh, ground zero for protests against the amended citizenship law - also claimed that he was only responding to AAPs Manish Sisodia.In his four-page response, Mishra quoted Sisodia saying at an event that he stands with the protesters of Shaheen Bagh. Kapil Mishra had offered a similar defence earlier in the day when he alleged that other political leaders such as Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were playing the communal card.Who is playing the Hindu-Muslim card? Manish Sisodia who says he is with Shaheen Bagh protesters? Priyanka Gandhi who supports those who burned vehicles at Turkman Gate in Delhi? Kejriwal who is distributing Rs 5 lakh to hooligans? Who are giving tickets to people like Amanatullah and Shoaib Iqbal, known for making provocative speeches? Mishra said in his tweet posted in Hindi.An AAP leader said the entire controversy around Kapil Mishras tweets appeared to be part of the BJPs strategy where its leadership had focussed on projecting as if only the Muslims were on the streets against changes to the citizenship law.',\n",

These were the folks who actually agreed that religion should determine nationhood...\"So, in the historical canon, the first advocate of the two-nation theory was actually V D Savarkar (Veer Damodar Savarkar), who as head of the Hindu Mahasabha had called upon India to recognise Hindus and Muslims as two separate nations, three years before the Muslim League passed the Pakistan resolution in the Lahore Session in 1940,\" Tharoor said.In a session \"Shashi on Shashi\" at the literary event, the Congress leader also spoke about the BJP using Gandhi as a symbol. \"That too because of brand value\" and after having \"tossed aside his principles\", he said.\"Gandhi was a devout Hindu but he was a person who had in his morning prayers Christian hymns, verses from the Quran, verses from the Guru Granth Sahib, and pretty much every religion which was there,\" Tharoor said.This was the kind of India Mahatma Gandhi stood for and as \"we all know he gave his life on the altar of Hindu-Muslim unity, he was killed by a former RSS member who believed passionately that Gandhiji was putting Muslim interests ahead of Hindu interests\", he said.Golwalkar had ridiculed Gandhi, who was a strong proponent of non-violence, saying \"all Hindu gods carried weapons\", and the Mahatma was \"fundamentally wrong\", Tharoor claimed.\"These are the kind of teachings that have been inculcated into the minds of the current rulers, no wonder Gandhiji has been reduced to just a pair of glasses. I mean his ideas, his values, his principles, and his life have completely been tossed aside, but his glasses, because of the brand value of the Gandhi name, are the symbol of Swachh Bharat campaign,\" the Congress leader said.',\n",

Therefore, it comes as no surprise when she says being tagged as a TVactor doesnt bother her at all. It has given me everything  name, fame and identity, and people still call me Prerna of Kasautii... I couldnt have asked for anything better, she smiles.At a time when many actors look down on the medium for its regressive content and have moved on to try their luck in films and web shows, Shweta says she can never quit TV. Some actors consider TV to be a smaller medium but thats wrong as times have changed and it is a much bigger medium now. She admits that somewhere the content on TV is still regressive and it needs to tell stories that are relatable and portray characters in a more progressive way. Wandering Alone is Fun!A post shared by  Shweta Tiwari (@shweta.tiwari) on Nov 5, 2019 at 6:24am PSTGiven that many TV shows are also being streamed on online platforms and getting a wider reach, Shweta feels it has gone worldwide. TV shows are, and will always remain a daily dose of entertainment for people. It has its reach in small towns and cities and even across the world in different dubbed languages. Because of this, many movie actors keep coming to TV shows for the promotion of their work. We shouldnt underrate it, adds the actor, currently seen in Mere Dad Ki Dulhan on Sony Entertainment Television.While the 39-year-old has also made her presence felt in the digital space with her show Hum Tum And Them, she says she still gets labelled for her unconventional choices.

And even my web show, which required me to do bold scenes, raised many eyebrows, she continues, But as an actor, it is my job. Work is worship, and even if I have to eat non-vegetarian on the day of my fast, I will do it.',\n",

All the cities that have been locked down are situated around the epicentre  Wuhan in Hubei province.The new cities where transport ban was imposed include Xianning, Xiaogan, Enshi and Zhijiang -- all located in Hubei province. Other cities which have already imposed such restrictions include Wuhan (from where the virus originated), Jingzhou, Huangshi, Qianjiang, Xiantao, Chibi, Ezhou, Huanggang and Lichuan.As part of the transport ban, China is closing all public transport services including train stations and airports. The move is part of the desperate measures to control the spread of the disease whose case has also been reported from foreign countries.In China, the outbreak of the disease has killed at least 26 people, with 830 other confirmed cases of infection.Several other cities in China have closed entertainment venues including theatres and karaoke bars in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.Shanghai Disneyland too has announced that it would remain shut until further notice. The Shanghai Disney Resort posted on its website that it decided on the temporary closure \"in response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety\" of its guests and staff.China has, meanwhile, started work to construct a new hospital in just 10 days so that patients at the epicentre could be treated. The hospital will come up in Wuhan, likely by February 3, as the number of patients infected with the virus surge.Pictures were relayed by state broadcaster CCTV showing dozens of excavators and trucks at the site where the hospital was being built. Xinhua said the hospital will be spread over 25,000 square metres.Image courtesy: Associated PressIn South Korea, a second case of the SARS-like virus was confirmed. The countrys health ministry said a South Korean man in his 50s possibly contracted the virus while working in Wuhan on January 10.Far away in the United Kingdom, 14 people underwent tests for the deadly coronavirus as the British government acknowledged an \"increased likelihood\" of its spread to the country. Five of these people had tested negative while the results were awaited for the rest nine.\"The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them,\" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock informed Parliament.What is coronavirus? A doctor explains how the Wuhan virus is treated - diet, precautions to takeIndia, though, has already started screening travellers coming from China.However, no case of coronavirus has been detected in the country so far.The Indian Embassy in Beijing on Friday announced that it was cancelling the scheduled Republic Day event on January 26 in view of the outbreak, and also issued an advisory to travellers headed to India.Meanwhile, two people who came back to India from China were kept under medical observation at the civic-run Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokali in Mumbai for possible exposure to the virus.\"No passenger was found positive (for the virus) during thermal scanning with history of a visit to Wuhan city of China in the last 14 days,\" a health department official said.In the meantime, Saudi Arabia denied that an Indian nurse had been confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus in the kingdom.

But he admits that these are tough times for the sport in the Olympic year with Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth struggling to secure automatic qualification spots.Gopichand also stressed the need to work on opponents being able to read certain strokes and game patterns of Indian shuttlers ahead of Tokyo 2020.Sindhu has struggled a bit. But she is someone who has consistently done well in the highest tournaments and I do believe that going into the Olympic year, knowing well these are the areas to be worked on, I am sure we will be able to sort it out, Gopichand told IANS on the sidelines of the launch of the book Dreams of a Billion: India and the Olympic Games at the TATA Steel Literary Meet.With Sindhu placed sixth in the qualification rankings, Saina who is ranked 22nd will need to be placed within the top 16 by the end of the qualification period which comes in April to be assured of a place in the Indian contingent that goes to Tokyo. The 26th ranked Srikanth finds himself in even more choppy waters and will need to get into the top 16  to ensure that he gets a spot in Tokyo alongwith Sai Praneeth who is ranked 11th.Its tough times. There are about 7-8 tournaments left for the end of the qualifications and they will need to really play well to get there. I think especially for Srikanth its an uphill task, Gopichand said.The last two tournaments have not gone well. Having said that, I am hopeful they will buck up and give some good performances.Sainas one or two good performances will get her a berth (in the Olympics) and she has beaten players like An Se-young in the Malaysian Open. I do hope that she comes strongly in coming tournaments.In a book, Gopichand had revealed how upset he was when Saina decided to join Prakash Padukones academy. Heaping praise on Indias first badminton superstar, Gopichand, a former All England Champion, said: She has come strongly from Rio 2016 setback. 2017 she had a medal at the World Championships. 2018 she had the Commonwealth gold and a medal at the Asian Games. She has done well overall and she has served the country for a very long period of time. If you look at her performances from 2009 till 2019 she was consistently in the top 10 of the world always. She has contributed immensely.On the areas the Indian contingent needs to work on, he said: Some of it might be specifics which I would not want to divulge. In the last few tournaments, we have seen certain mistakes which have crept in. Players being able to read certain strokes and game patterns so thats what we need to change.Gopichand also said all Indian players have the ability to shine in Tokyo as it takes two good matches to turn a corner going by the Olympics format.The format of Olympics is such that every player who goes in with good preparation has a chance. At the end of the day, two good matches can bring you into the medal rounds. I do believe all our players have the ability to do that. I am waiting for qualification to get over, hopefully we will have a good number going, he concluded.',\n",

It further suggested that political parties should be asked not to give tickets to people with a criminal background.A bench of Justices RF Nariman and S Ravindra Bhat had asked the EC to come up with a framework within one week so as to help curb criminalisation of politics in the interest of the nation.The bench then directed BJP leader and advocate-petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay and the EC to sit together and come up with suggestions to help curb criminalisation of politics.In September 2018, a five-judge Constitution bench in a unanimous decision said that all candidates will have to declare their criminal antecedents to the EC before contesting polls. The bench further called for wider publicity, through print and electronic media about candidates from a criminal background so as to inform the voters.The 2019 Lok Sabha election witnessed an overall increase in the number of criminals. The report released by the National Election Watch and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) showed an increase in the number of criminal candidates contesting the 2019 elections.Over 342 candidates with criminal cases are contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the report said.Out of the 7,928 candidates, 1,500 candidates had declared criminal cases against themselves.On October 10, 2018, the EC issued a notification regarding the amended Form-26 and directions to political parties and candidates for publication of criminal antecedents.As per the media inputs, the Congress had named 47 more candidates with criminal cases in 2019 while the BJP named 59 more such candidates.Studies have shown that having criminal cases boosts the winning prospect of the candidate and that criminal record does not bother the voters from voting for the candidates with a criminal background.',\n",

The other countries on the top include Norway (7), the Netherlands (8), Germany and Luxembourg (joint 9th).Transparency International said that the 2020 analysis shows that the rate of corruption is pervasive more in the countries where large volumes of money can flow freely into political campaigns and in places where governments listen to only the wealthy and high-profile individuals.According to the report, even in democracies like India and Australia, opaque and unfair electoral financing and wrongful influence in the decision-making process, along with lobbying by powerful corporates, lead to a decline in control or stagnation of corruption.Not only are more than two-thirds of countries  along with many of the worlds most advanced economies  stagnating, but some are also seriously backsliding. In the last eight years, only 22 countries have shown significant improvement on the CPI, while almost as many have declined, PTI quoted the report as saying.',\n",
       " 'IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on Friday said growth slowdown in India appears to be temporary and she expects the momentum to improve going ahead.Speaking here at the WEF 2020, she also said the world appears a better place in January 2020 compared to what it was when IMF announced its World Economic Outlook in October 2019. She said the factors driving this positive momentum include receding trade tension after the US-China first phase trade deal and synchronised tax cuts, among others. She, however, said a growth rate of 3.3 per cent is not fantastic for the world economy. It is still sluggish growth. We want fiscal policies to be more aggressive and we want structural reforms and more dynamism, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. On emerging markets, she said they are also moving forward. We had a downgrade in one large market India but we believe thats temporary. We expect momentum to improve further going ahead. There are also some bright spots like Indonesia and Vietnam, she noted. She further said a number of African countries are doing very well, but some other nations like Mexico are not. On risks ahead for the global economy, the IMF chief listed factors like weakness in long-term productivity growth and low inflation. We are living in a more risk-prone world. It is only January and there have been events that are sparking risks for the global economy, she added. ',\n",
       " 'Right from his maiden Bollywood outing Vicky Donor (2012) to his last onscreen joyride Bala (2019) and the upcoming edutainer on homosexuality, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, a beacon of hope for social change has been the mainstay in Ayushmann Khurranas movies. Ahead of the countrys Republic Day, the actor, who takes pride in equality, says hes a socially aware citizen and adds that his choice of cinema will always hinge upon socially relevant issues, which could initiate a discussion. Excerpts from the interview:It shows India in a progressive stance when it comes to homosexuality and the LGBTQ community. It has decriminalised Section 377 (of the Indian Penal Code)and we cant be more proud.Id always aspire to do subjects which are socially relevant, which would create a stir or usher some kind of discussion. Yes, I am a socially aware citizen. Ive done street theatre where we touched upon many socially relevant issues, and the cinema Im doing is an extension of my theatre days.  We just teased you with the trailer of #ShubhMangalZyadaSaavdhan Thanks for your love. A post shared by  Ayushmann Khurrana (@ayushmannk) on Jan 21, 2020 at 7:47pm PSTThe significance of Republic Day is being one with your nation, enjoying your country as a multi-cultural unit. And for me, patriotism is improving your country and not just blindly loving your country. Its about changing our nation for the better. Patriotism comes with a responsibility, the love for your country. Like Ive reiterated, this isnt blind love. There is unity in diversity. This is our biggest strength and our biggest weakness, that we are diverse. We have to be together. What I celebrate is that India is a melting pot of culture. What I despise is the lack of cleanliness. Were not clean as a country. Even those countries which have smaller economies are cleaner than us.Also read: Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan is about embracing LGBTQ community, says Ayushmann KhurranaDefinitely. The kind of views and comments weve seen for the trailer on YouTube shows the progressive stance of our country and it is ready for a film based on homosexuality. It shows that our country has accepted the trailer of the film. Its 2020, and high time that we have a mainstream and a  commercial Hindi cinema on a gay love story.As an industry, were the most inclusive. We dont care what caste, colour, creed you belong to or what your sexuality is. We only care about your talent.

Williamson lauded the visitors for putting the hosts under the pump throughout their chase of a massive total in the curtain-raiser contested at Auckland\\'sEden Park stadium.

       " 'Jean Paul Gaultier was never going to make a French exit from the fashion world. The 67-year-old designer staged his swansong on Wednesday evening, bidding adieu to the industry as loudly as he could.Supermodels were joined by celebrities, dancers, contortionists and drag queens on stage at the Thtre du Chtelet  an unforgettable show that had the hundreds of audience members cheering non-stop for almost two hours. For many there, it was an emotional goodbye, not only because Gaultier is beloved for his iconic designs, but because he is one of the few living designers to be considered a national treasure, instantly recognisable to the public for his peroxide hair, Breton stripes and Cheshire cat grin.The show resembled a party. It began with a projection of the dramatic funeral scene from William Kleins satirical 1966 film Qui Est Vous, Polly Maggoo?, followed by the curtains falling on a dim-lit tableau of supermodels in mourning. Erin OConnor, Farida Khelfa, Estelle Lefbure and Yasmin Le Bon  models from Gaultiers past  were among those posing as cartoonishly camp funeral-goers.Boy George sang a cover of Amy Winehouses Back to Black as dancers in gimp masks brought out a spiked coffin. The atmosphere was far from sombre. Never one to take himself too seriously, it was a reminder of Gaultiers irreverent sense of humour and kitsch. It set the tone for the rest of the show, a celebration of the leitmotifs that the French designer has returned to throughout his career.There were the marinires Breton stripes in myriad ways, the corsetry that he famously transformed from a symbol of female oppression into a postmodern feminist statement in the 1990s, and pastiches of Parisian stereotypes such as tuxedos, white shirts and black wigs. Denim, camouflage and bondage styling made appearances too, occasionally modelled by Gaultiers celebrity friends. Amanda Lear appeared in little more than a sequinned T-shirt, carried down the steps by two topless hunks, while Batrice Dalle walked out smoking a cigarette, only to throw it towards the audience. Rossy de Palma looked every inch the salsa seorita in black and red, a stark contrast to Dita von Teese in a nude corset.Gaultier said this was his first upcycled haute couture collection  implying that his decision to retire is partly caused by the shifting perception of the fashion industry in light of the climate crisis. I think fashion has to change, he wrote in a letter to every guest at the show. There are too many clothes, and too many clothes that are useless. Do not throw them away, recycle them! Thats what he did, delving into his archive to revive style and using previous collections to create new outfits.What I did in my early days without means, I do today with my heritage to give life to new creations, he added.Although he may have always been described as the enfant terrible of fashion, today Gaultier is one the industrys minence grise. In many ways, it took the fashion world decades to catch up with him. As early as 1976 he was a pioneer of diversity, streetwear, gender-fluidity and recycling  all of which are now marketing buzzwords for fashion houses. For Gaultier, however, it was second nature. He simply reflected what he saw on the streets by putting it on the catwalk.He was often a champion of models who defied easy categorisation  whether that was in age, body, gender or race  often scouting them on the street too. His clothes were shown on both men and women, which led people to describe his work as androgynous long before gender-neutral was in parlance.When he showed men in skirts in 1984, it caused as much controversy as when Madonna walked on stage in his famous cone bra during her Blond Ambition tour in 1990 or when she appeared topless in the 1993 fashion show Gaultier staged as an Aids fundraiser.Despite his iconoclasm, Gaultier is rarely spoken of with the same reverence as his contemporaries, such as the late Karl Lagerfeld or Azzedine Alaa. That might be because he appeared as a co-presenter on the satirical television show Eurotrash, which was sneered at by the fashion world but managed to endear him to a mainstream audience and convey his naughty sense of humour. He later said that was the reason he missed out on the artistic directorship of Dior in 1996, which went to John Galliano instead.Over the years, his business dwindled, despite a steady income from his bestselling fragrances. In 2015, he shuttered his ready-to-wear label and continued to produce only two haute couture collections a year.Yet his influence can still be felt across generations. The theatricality of his shows inspired designers such as Galliano and Alexander McQueen. Many fashion household names began their careers as his employees, including Martin Margiela and Nicolas Ghesquire, both of whom were present last night to pay their respects, joined by the likes of Isabel Marant, Dries van Noten, the shoe guru Christian Louboutin, Clare Waight Keller, Christian Lacroix, and the fashion couple Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren. All of them cheered, some of them cried  and even Anna Wintour could not contain her excitement as the show became more theatrical and camp as it went on.Although this was the last Jean Paul Gaultier show, he said there would be projects to come. For now, it is the end of an era. Fashions enfant terrible has finally grown out of the industry he revolutionised.',\n",

       " 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations officials do not use WhatsApp to communicate because its not supported as a secure mechanism, a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday, after U.N. experts accused Saudi Arabia of using the online communications platform to hack the phone of Amazon chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. The independent U.N. experts said on Wednesday they had information pointing to the possible involvement of Saudi Arabias Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the alleged 2018 cyberattack on the billionaire Amazon.com Inc chief. They called for an immediate investigation by U.S. and other authorities, based on a forensic report by Washington-based FTI Consulting. The report alleges that Bezos iPhone was hijacked by a malicious video file sent from a WhatsApp account used by the crown prince.  When asked if U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had communicated with the Saudi crown prince or any other world leaders using WhatsApp, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said on Thursday: The senior officials at the U.N. have been instructed not to use WhatsApp, its not supported as a secure mechanism. So no, I do not believe the secretary-general uses it, Haq said. He later added that the directive not to use WhatsApp was given to U.N. officials in June last year. When asked about the move by the United Nations, WhatsApp said it provides industry leading security for more than 1.5 billion users.  Every private message is protected by end-to-end encryption to help prevent WhatsApp or others from viewing chats. The encryption technology that we developed with Signal is highly regarded by security experts and remains the best available for people around the world, said WhatsApp Director of Communications Carl Woog.     For that reason, any ban that specifically singles out WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook Inc, might leave digital security experts scratching their heads.  WhatsApp is taking security very seriously compared to others, said researcher Oded Vanunu, whose company, Tel Aviv-based Checkpoint, regularly finds flaws in messaging apps. Every application has vulnerabilities you can exploit in some way, he said, before noting that WhatsApp was particularly good at fixing them. Other instant messaging companies can dream of their kind of security procedures, he said. Reporting by Michelle Nichols and Raphael Satter; Editing by Tom Brown',\n",
       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - Walt Disney Cos Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed until further notice to help China stop the spread of a flu-like virus, costing the theme park operator revenue during the countrys biggest holiday season. China is on a seven-day Lunar New Year holiday, a period when the Shanghai Disney park would be usually packed with tourists. Last year Shanghai Disney had to stop selling tickets to visitors as the park got overcrowded. In response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety of our guests and Cast, Shanghai Disney Resort is temporarily closing Shanghai Disneyland, Disneytown ... starting Jan. 25, the company said on its website. We will continue to carefully monitor the situation and ... announce the reopening date upon confirmation. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, and neighboring Huanggang, a city of about 7 million people, were in virtual lockdown, with restrictions in place elsewhere. A new coronavirus which broke out in Wuhan, central China, late last year has killed 25 people and infected more than 800. Many businesses including retailers, airlines, travel agencies and hotel operators are on high alert, as health authorities fear the infection rate could accelerate over the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad. The outbreak has already prompted seven Chinese films that were set to premiere during the holiday to postpone screenings, forgoing what is usually the best week of the year at the Chinese box office. Disney said it would refund tickets for admission to Shanghai Disneyland, on Chinas east coast, more than 800 km from Wuhan, or other services at the park as well as hotel bookings. The estimated financial impact on the U.S. companys first theme park in mainland China, which opened in mid-2016 in its largest overseas investment at $5.5 billion, was not immediately clear. The company was not immediately available to comment.     Shanghai Disney carried out a resort-wide makeover this month for a four-week event through Feb. 9 to celebrate the Year of the Rat with its characters including Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and target Chinas middle class and booming domestic tourism. Walt Disney Co owns a 43% stake in Shanghai Disney Resort which has Shanghai Disneyland theme park and two hotels with a total of 1,220 rooms. The impact on businesses is set to increase as China discourages locals from gathering in crowded places. It has already stepped up measures to contain the virus, with public transport suspensions in 10 cities, the shutting of temples and closing the Forbidden City, Beijings most famous tourist attraction. Japans Fast Retailing Co Ltd said on Friday it has temporarily closed 17 Uniqlo stores in Wuhan. China is a key growth market for the company which faces a saturated market and weak consumer spending in Japan.

Considering the number of beneficiaries and quality, water supply is not free in Delhi. There is no scheme, no notification for free power supply and it was announced as a freebie before the polls in a hurry to lure the voters, he said.Congress, AAPs other opponent in the Delhi Assembly elections, too had took on Delhi chief minister over his politics around freebies. Alka Lamba, who was in the AAP before she returned to the Congress, said Kejriwal should be focussing on providing jobs and houses instead of doling out free services.Arvind Kejriwal says freebies are his USP. But, if you ask people about it, they would say they dont want freebies, they want houses, jobs and relief from inflation. They are saying that if he can provide these three things, they will take care of their electricity and water bills, Lamba told Hindustantimes.com.The AAP government sought to fulfil pending pre-poll promises in 2019 and made a string of announcements like free-bus rides for women, no electricity charges of up to 200 units, free WiFi, free pilgrimage for senior citizens and waiver of development charges for new water and sewer connections.Kejriwal had earlier defended the move, saying the AAP government did this without increasing taxes, and still maintained a Budget surplus.

       " 'Billionaire George Soros said that nothing is keeping Facebook Inc. from spreading disinformation and the company may be in cahoots with President Donald Trump to get him re-elected.I think there is a kind of informal mutual assistance operation or agreement developing between Trump and Facebook, Soros, 89, said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Facebook will work together to re-elect Trump, and Trump will work to protect Facebook so that this situation cannot be changed and it makes me very concerned about the outcome for 2020.Soros didnt offer any evidence for his claim. This is just plain wrong, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in response.Soros has used his annual Davos speech as a platform to criticize the social media giant in the past. In 2018, he compared Facebook to a gambling company that fosters addiction among users, and last year reiterated the need to regulate technology firms.Facebook has come under increased scrutiny from governments worldwide on multiple fronts, but especially related to the Russian misinformation campaign that ran undetected on the social network in the months prior to the 2016 election.The company has since worked to improve its technology for taking down what it calls coordinated inauthentic behavior -- efforts by foreign governments to manipulate public conversation. But critics argue that Trump is helped anyway by Facebooks very nature: the platform rewards content with the potential to go viral, and Trump has a tendency to say incendiary things.After public backlash, Facebook debated whether to take down political ads that contain lies. The company decided earlier this year that it would not, with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg citing first amendment values and saying it shouldnt be up to a corporation to determine what political messages are true or false.That message assuaged Republicans, who have interrogated the company about a perceived anti-conservative bias. Still, the companys algorithm may tilt the scales, giving rise to more shocking messages.Facebook basically has only one guiding principle: maximize your profits irrespective of what harm it may do to the world, Soros said Thursday.After Soross 2018 Davos speech, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg asked staff to look into whether Soros had a financial incentive to criticize the company through his holdings or trading activity. The company also hired an opposition research firm to examine whether Soros financially supported anti-Facebook groups. The decision was later uncovered in a New York Times report about Sandbergs mishandling of crises.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Marie Antoinettes hair turned white overnight, according to folklore, before she was executed by guillotine in 1793 during the French Revolution. The ill-fated queen embodied an extreme example of the phenomenon of stress-induced graying of the hair. The biological mechanism behind such graying had long remained a mystery. But researchers said on Wednesday they have figured outhowit happens: it is driven by the bodys fight-or-flight response to danger. The researchers used mouse experiments to look at how stress affects the stem cells in hair follicles that are responsible for making melanocytes, the pigment-producingcells that give hair its color - black, brown, blonde, red or somewhere in between. People generally have around 100,000 hair follicles on their scalp. The researchers initially suspected that an stress-induced immune attack might be targetingthe melanocytestem cells, but that hypothesis did not pan out. They then explored whether the hormone cortisol, elevated under stress, might be the culprit, but also was a dead end. Instead they found that the bodys sympathetic nervous system, which governs the mammalian fight-or-flight response to danger, played a central role. It comprises a network of nervesthat go everywhere including the skin, in which they are like ribbons wrapping aroundeach hair follicleand are very close to the melanocyte stem cells. When mice were subjected to short-term pain or placed in stressful laboratory conditions, these nerves released thechemical norepinephrine, which was then taken up by the stem cells in the hair follicle that serve as a finite reservoir of melanocytes. Normally, when hair regenerates,someof these stem cells convert into pigment-producing cells that color the hair. But when they are exposed to norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerve,allof the stem cells are activated and convert into pigment-producing cells, said Ya-Chieh Hsu, associate professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard University and a Harvard Stem Cell Institute principal investigator. That means there are none left. In just a few days, the reservoir of pigment-regenerating stem cells is depleted. And once theyre gone, you cant regenerate pigment anymore, added Hsu, senior author of the research published in the journal Nature. Hair graying is one of the many ways that stress exacts a toll on the body. The findings could guide development of treatments for stress-related graying, or potentially other stress-related changes in tissues, though this could take years, she said. Stress is not the only reason hair can turn gray. The natural aging process is the leading cause. Genetic mutations and in some cases immune attacks also can contribute to hair losing its color. Melanocyte stem cells are also lost during aging, Hsu said. An interesting hypothesis could be that stress is an accelerated aging process. But we dont know if that is true yet. We are interested in finding out the link. Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There have been few chuckles during U.S. President Donald Trumps impeachment trial in the Senate. But a wisecrack on Thursday about Russian President Vladimir Putin produced some laughter, at least from the Democratic side of the chamber. Representative Adam Schiff, the leader of the House of Representatives team making the case for Trumps impeachment, recalled how Putin in November had said he was relieved that Ukraine, instead of Russia, was now being accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Thank God, Putin said, Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in U.S. elections, now theyre accusing Ukraine, Schiff said. Thank God, Putin says, Schiff continued. Well, you gotta give Donald Trump credit for this, he has made a religious man out of Vladimir Putin.  There was plenty of laughter among Democratic senators at this, but it was not shared on the Republican side of the Senate. I dont think we really want Vladimir Putin, our adversary to be thanking God for the president of the United States. Because they dont wish us well, Schiff, a Democrat, added.

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese city of Wuhan is rapidly building a new 1,000-bed hospital to treat victims of a new coronavirus, mobilizing machinery to get it ready by early next week, state media said. The virus has killed 25 people in China and infected more than 800, the government said on Friday, as the World Health Organisation declared it an emergency but stopped short of declaring the epidemic of international concern. Most of the cases are in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated late last year. The new hospital is being built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city, the official Changjiang Daily reported on Friday. Prefabricated buildings, which will have 1,000 beds, will be put up, it said. Building machinery, including 35 diggers and 10 bulldozers, arrived at the site on Thursday night, with the aim to get the new facility ready by Monday, the paper added. The construction of this project is to solve the shortage of existing medical resources, the report said. Because it will be prefabricated buildings, it will not only be built fast but it also wont cost much. China State Construction Engineering, one of the companies building the hospital, said on Friday it was doing all it can and would overcome difficulties to play its part, adding it now had more than 100 workers on the site. Images on state television showed a flurry of activity at the muddy building site with dozens of diggers painted in multiple colors hard at work preparing the ground, as a stream of trucks ferried in materials and equipment. The hospital aims to copy the experience of Beijing in 2003, when the city battled Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). As many as 774 people died globally in the SARS epidemic, which reached nearly 30 countries. At the time, Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week. Within two months, it treated one-seventh of all the countrys SARS patients, the Changjiang Daily said. It created a miracle in the history of medical science, the paper added. The Beijing hospital, built by 7,000 workers, was originally designed only to take people who were in recovery from SARS to relieve pressure on other hospitals. In the end it treated nearly 700 SARS patients. Reporting by Beijing newsroom; Writing by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan and Sam Holmes',\n",
       " 'Vir Das is quick to admit that he has always seen himself as the outsider. He is just as capable of self-deprecation -- Im five foot eight-and-a-half and I dont know anybody, he told Hindustan Times -- as he is to making self-important statements such as this: Im a comedian who does Bollywood and a Bollywood guy who does comedy.  Im an Indian for the Western audiences and Western for the Indian audiences. Hes always had an outsiders perspective, he said. No wonder the comedian Sorabh Pant at a recent event described Das as the Priyanka Chopra of comedy.Pant used to write jokes for Das back in the day, when standup comedy in India was still finding its footing. As someone who has long been considered somewhat of a pioneer, Das said he has learned that the more powerful they are, the cooler they are with the joke. In his latest special, Vir Das: For India, his third for the streaming giant Netflix, the comedian punches up at powerful corporations and personalities, without ever losing the moral compass that he prides himself on having. Ive performed for the biggest people in India and made fun of them to their face  from Bollywood to companies and corporations, he said. Im a very small fish in their pond.  Das said that he doesnt self-censor at all and that to his mind, The guy who gets upset is never the politician or the businessman, its the guy who loves the politician or the businessman.He does, however, express his irritation towards the uncle community thats running the country and running the world. All I know is that Ive never been screamed at by anybody but an uncle, and Ive never gotten into trouble with anybody but an uncle, Das said. The aunties and young people, however, have always been great to him. We have to get aunties voices out there and we have to get young boys and young girls voices out there.But this is the first time Das has done a special about India and he said he realises that youre not going to get away with doing a show about India and not talk about these things. By these things the comedian is perhaps referring to the transitional phase that Indian is currently experiencing. Das has been very vocal in recent months about issues as wide-ranging as the student-led protests across the country against the controversial CAA-NRC acts, and a rise in the misreporting of facts by mainstream media. But he has a hack. The best way to address it in a way that brings everybody together, he said, so dont make it too one-sided or at the very least dont cushion the fact that this is your opinion.Follow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar',\n",

       " 'When Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79, the damage wreaked in nearby towns was catastrophic. Now it appears the heat was so immense it turned one victims brain to glass  thought to be the first time this has been seen. Experts say they have discovered that splatters of a shiny, solid black material found inside the skull of a victim at Herculaneum appear to be the remains of human brain tissue transformed by heat.They say the find is remarkable since brain tissue is rarely preserved at all due to decomposition, and where it is found it has typically turned to soap.To date, vitrified remains of the brain have never been found, said Dr Pier Paolo Petrone, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Naples Federico II and a co-author of the study.Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, Petrone and colleagues reveal that the glassy brains belonged to a man of about 25 who was found in the 1960s lying face-down on a wooden bed under a pile of volcanic ash  a pose that suggests he was asleep when disaster struck the town.The bed was in a small room that was part of the Collegium Augustalium, a building relating to an imperial cult that worshipped the former emperor Augustus. The victim, according to Petrone, is believed to have been the caretaker.Petrone said it was when he recently focused his research on human remains found at the college that he noticed the black fragments in the caretakers skull.I noticed something shining inside the head , he told the Guardian. This material was preserved exclusively in the victims skull, thus it had to be the vitrified remains of the brain. But it had to be proved beyond any reasonable doubt.Now Petrone and colleagues have revealed a number of substances within the glassy material, including proteins typically found in brain tissue. Crucially, these were not found in adjacent ash or elsewhere in the site.The detection of glassy material from the victims head, of proteins expressed in human brain, and of fatty acids found in human hair indicates the thermally induced preservation of vitrified human brain tissue, the team write.The researchers say that while some of the substances may also be found in animal or plant matter, no such remains were reported during excavations. And analysis of charred wood on the site reveals that it experienced temperatures of up to 520C (968F) during the catastrophe.This suggests extreme radiant heat was able to ignite body fat and vaporise soft tissues; a rapid drop in temperature followed, the team reports.Petrone said the caretaker was killed instantly when deadly currents of superheated gases, ash and rock fragments, known as pyroclastic flows, swept through the town.Other evidence backs up the grisly fate: the caretakers skull and other bones had exploded and become charred, while some of the bones  as well as a fragment of charred wood  also showed signs of glassiness.The team also found a solid, spongy mass around the chest bones, probably formed from the lungs and other organs, Petrone said.The team say this reflects accounts of victims of the Dresden bombings during the second world war, which referred to bodies being reduced to a mixture of bones and a jelly-like substance when exposed to intense heat.The new discoveries are the latest revelation in a long line of harrowing finds from the disaster. Previous work by Petrone and colleagues on human remains from Herculaneum have suggested the intense heat of the pyroclastic flow vaporised the bodily fluids of those who sheltered in the towns waterfront chambers and exploded their skulls. However, no vitrified human brain tissues were found among these victims, suggesting slightly different conditions to those at the Collegium Augustalium.Meanwhile, plaster casts of victims in nearby Pompeii have captured in stillness the last moments of the towns inhabitants  crouched, braced or huddled as the ash and pumice fell.Petrone says the findings emphasise that the only way to survive an eruption like that of AD79 is to flee. Even if sheltered within buildings people will die due to the high temperature of the ash surges, as demonstrated by the victims of Herculaneum, Pompeii and even further settlements, as far as 20km from the volcano, he said. A silent warning for the 3 million inhabitants of metropolitan Naples.',\n",

       " 'SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea on Friday confirmed that Ri Son Gwon, a former defense commander with limited diplomatic experience, has been appointed the countrys new foreign affairs minister, while the United States repeated calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.  North Koreas official KCNA news agency reported that Ri, the latest military official to be promoted under North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, gave a speech as minister at a New Year dinner reception hosted by the ministry on Thursday for embassies and international organizations. North Korea informed countries with embassies in Pyongyang last week that Ri, a former military officer and now a senior official of the ruling Workers Party, had replaced Ri Yong Ho as Pyongyangs top diplomat. The appointment came as a surprise to North Korea watchers amid stalled denuclearization talks with Washington, as Ri does not have any experience in dealing with nuclear issues or U.S. officials. His predecessor was a career diplomat and seasoned nuclear negotiator, though he often took a backseat to military officer-turned-party envoys during the last two years of diplomacy. The new foreign minister did, however, lead high-level inter-Korean talks in 2018 as chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country, which handles South Korea affairs.  His predecessor did not attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in September and Seoul-based NK News said his absence from a group photo of top ruling party officials at a meeting in January raised speculation that he may have been replaced amid a broader political reshuffle.  In Washington, the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, David Stilwell - himself a former military officer - told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank he had no idea as to the background and stance of the new minister, but added: There was a change; I think that itself indicates something. I hope its positive to say, maybe we should change our tack and come to the table and have the discussions we committed to. Stilwell said the best approach for Washington and its allies was to maintain a solid position and wait until Pyongyang returned to talks based on a commitment Washington says Kim made in a 2018 summit with President Donald Trump to abandon his countrys nuclear arms. I like that fact that we arent in a rush, Stilwell said. Weve stated our position, we made our agreements and we are going to insist that the other side follows through with those. North Korea reiterated on Tuesday it was no longer bound by commitments to halt nuclear and missile testing, blaming the United States failure to meet a year-end deadline to show more flexibility in talks and brutal and inhumane sanctions. Separately on Friday, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Washington was disappointed by Russias failure to repatriate North Korean workers by a December deadline as required under U.N. sanctions. Russia said on Thursday it had missed the deadline due to what it called objective difficulties, and that around 1,000 North Korean workers were still in Russia. A senior U.S. official said on Wednesday China had also failed to send home North Korean workers by the deadline, leading Washington to blacklist two entities involved in Pyongyangs labor export.   Last month, China and Russia proposed the lifting of some U.N. sanctions on North Korea, including the labor export ban, to encourage talks between Washington and Pyongyang. We expect all U.N. member states to fulfill their obligations under the U.N. Security Council Resolutions that were unanimously adopted, the State Department spokeswoman said.

       " \"BEIJING (Reuters) - A new coronavirus that has killed 26 people in China was confirmed in Europe for the first time on Friday as it spreads despite Chinese attempts to quarantine the city at the heart of the outbreak. China closed Shanghai Disneyland and part of the Great Wall and suspended public transportation in 10 cities as it rushed to contain the virus, stranding millions of people at the start of the countrys Lunar New Year holiday. France reported two cases on Friday evening, the first ones discovered in Europe. More were likely, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said. Wuhan, a city of 11 million where the virus was first identified, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at Wuhans airport have been canceled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town. As the city slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said. Despite the lockdown, the virus is already spreading further afield. The vast majority of the cases and all of the deaths have been in China, but it has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the new virus.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases, both in people who had traveled to Wuhan. Following a congressional briefing by health officials, Republican U.S. Senator John Barrasso, a former physician, said people in the United States with the virus may have been infected up to 14 days ago in China. We want to try to stop and prevent people from coming to the United States if they have it, Barrasso told reporters, without providing details of how that might be accomplished.  Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.       It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.  Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing medical conditions, the World Health Organization said. As of Thursday, Chinas National Health Commission said there were 830 confirmed cases and 26 deaths. Most cases have been in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife. As China scrambles to contain the outbreak, it has suspended transportation in 10 cities in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, the Hubei Daily reported. The country will take further, more targeted measures, state television reported, citing a State Council meeting on Friday. It did not give further details. Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency, state broadcaster CCTV said. Week-long celebrations to welcome the Year of the Rat began on Friday, raising fears that the infection rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of people travel to see family at home and abroad. In Wuhan, a handful of people got off a high-speed train that pulled into the citys station on Friday but nobody boarded. What choice do I have? Its Chinese New Year. We have to see our family, said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu. As part of the restrictions, some sections of the Great Wall near Beijing will be closed from Saturday, state media said. Beijings Lama Temple, where people traditionally make offerings for the new year, has closed, as have some other temples and the Forbidden City, the capitals most famous tourist attraction. Shanghai Disneyland will close starting on Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last years new year holiday. Film premieres have been postponed and McDonalds suspended business in five cities in Hubei province. Theres so much news, so much data, every 10 minutes theres an update, its frightening, especially for people like us in a severely hit area, Lily Jin, 30, a resident of Wuhan, told Reuters by phone. The WHO said on Thursday it was a bit too early to designate the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, which would require countries to step up their response. That decision could well be reassessed in coming days as the situation evolves, said Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Institutes of Healths top infectious disease official, adding that it was open to question whether shutting down travel would have a major effect. The mass involuntary quarantine in Wuhan and its neighboring cities is counterproductive, added Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. A lockdown of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground, provoking fear and panic.  Some experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as the one that caused the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also began in China and killed nearly 800 people, or the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012. Three international research teams - using different approaches - have begun work on vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said. Markets have been roiled this week on fears that the outbreak will curb travel and hurt economic demand. Shares in luxury goods companies have been particularly hard hit on fears of a drop in demand from China.

       " 'Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde on Thursday frowned at death row convicts endlessly filing petitions, observing that the Supreme Court should focus not only on rights of the accused but victims as well. Chief Justice Bobdes observations, were made in context of a petition from a couple from Uttar Pradeshs Amroha.The two had been handed out the death penalty for sedating the womans family and hacking them to death in April 2008. A 10-month-old baby was also among the seven people murdered by them. The infant was strangled.The couple was arrested within five days and sentenced to death in 2010.The Supreme Court had cancelled their execution warrant in 2015 on grounds that the magistrate had acted in haste and the convicts were yet to exercise their legal options.As the hearing resumed on their plea on Thursday, Chief Justice Bobde remarked that it was extremely important for the death sentence to have some finality. A death row convict shouldnt feel that the sentence can be questioned all the time, Chief Justice Bobde said, stressing that one cannot go on fighting endlessly.We dont want to focus or emphasise only on rights of accused in a case in which 7 people including a 10-month-old baby have been murdered, the Chief Justice said.The top judges observation comes just a day after the central government requested the Supreme Court to amend its 2014 verdict that laid down guidelines on handling mercy petitions. The Shatrughan Chauhan judgment also mandated a gap of 14 days between the rejection of mercy petition and the scheduled date of execution to prevent secret executions and give the convict time to prepare for his or her death.The government, in its petition urged the court to adopt a victim-centric approach in heinous crimes so that faith of the public in judicial process is not shaken.The Centres request was made against the backdrop of the delay in carrying out the death warrant of the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang rape case has been widely criticised. The mother of the victim has been especially critical of the process.The delay has also become a political issue with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in power in the Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party, which governs Delhi trading charges. Elections in Delhi are to be held on February 8.',\n",
       " 'The Trump administration has published new visa rules aimed at restricting pregnant women travelling to the United States to give birth so their children can have US citizenship, a practice known as birth tourism.Applicants will be denied tourist visas if they are determined by consular officers to be coming to the US primarily to give birth, according to the rules in the Federal Register. They will have to prove they are traveling to the US because they have a medical need and not just because they want to give birth here.Children who are born in the US are automatically granted American citizenship, a right guaranteed by the 14th amendment of the constitution.The practice of traveling to the US to give birth is fundamentally legal, although there are scattered cases of authorities arresting operators of birth tourism agencies for visa fraud or tax evasion. And women are often honest about their intentions when applying for visas and even show signed contracts with doctors and hospitals.Those with medical needs will be treated like other foreigners coming to the US for medical treatment and must prove they have the money to pay for it  including transportation and living expenses.Closing this glaring immigration loophole will combat these endemic abuses and ultimately protect the United States from the national security risks created by this practice, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement.It will also defend American taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism. The integrity of American citizenship must be protected.The state department does not believe that visiting the United States for the primary purpose of obtaining US citizenship for a child, by giving birth in the United States  an activity commonly referred to as birth tourism  is a legitimate activity for pleasure or of a recreational nature, according to the new rules, which take effect on Friday.While the new rules deal specifically with birth tourism, the Trump administration also has turned away pregnant women coming over the US-Mexico border as part of a broader immigration crackdown. Those women were initially part of a vulnerable group that included others like small children who were allowed in, while tens of thousands of other asylum seekers have been returned to Mexico to wait out their cases.Donald Trumps administration has been restricting all forms of immigration, but recently, Trump has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the issue of birthright citizenship. The Republican president has railed against the practice and threatened to end it, but scholars and members of his administration have said its not so easy to do.Regulating tourist visas for pregnant women is one way to get at the issue, but it raises questions about how officers would determine whether a woman is pregnant to begin with and whether a woman could get turned away by border officers who suspect she may be just by looking at her.And critics of the new policy say it could put pregnant women at risk.Consular officers do not have the right to ask during visa interviews whether a woman is pregnant or intends to become so. But they would still have to determine whether a visa applicant would be coming to the US primarily to give birth.Birth tourism is a lucrative business in the US and abroad. Companies take out advertisements and charge up to $80,000 to facilitate the practice, offering hotel rooms and medical care. Many of the women travel from Russia and China to give birth in the US.The US has been cracking down on the practice since before Trump took office.An entire birth tourism industry has evolved to assist pregnant women from other countries to come to the United States to obtain US citizenship for their children by giving birth in the United States, and thereby entitle their children to the benefits of US citizenship, according to the state department rules.There are no figures on how many foreign women travel to the US specifically to give birth. The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for stricter immigration laws, estimated that in 2012 about 36,000 foreign-born women gave birth in the US and then left the country.This rule will help eliminate the criminal activity associated with the birth tourism industry, according to the rules. The recent federal indictments describe birth tourism schemes in which foreign nationals applied for visitor visas to come to the United States and lied to consular officers about the duration of their trips, where they would stay, and their purpose of travel.',\n",
       " 'ormer president Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday came out in support of the present wave of largely peaceful protests\" across the country, saying the stir will deepen Indias democratic roots.Mukherjee was speaking at the first memorial lecture of Indias first chief election commissioner Sukumar Sen, organized by the Election Commission of India (ECI).The last few months have witnessed people come out on the streets in large numbers, particularly the young, to voice their views on issues, which in their opinion, are important. Their assertion and belief in the Constitution of India is particularly heartening to see,\" Mukherjee said.Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent. I believe the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have gripped the country shall once again enable further deepening of our democratic roots,\" he added.While Mukherjee did not specify the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or CAA, in his address, his remarks have come amid the protests against the bill. Those opposing the CAA say it is discriminates against Muslims and is unconstitutional.This is the first time that Mukherjee, formerly a Union minister and senior Congress leader, has made public remarks about the protests.In his address, the former president said there were three key challenges faced by the ECI. These include a possible amendment to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) to lift the embargo on development work during its enforcement period, taking steps for ensuring adequate representation of women in Parliament and legislative assemblies, and revisiting the disproportionately large size of electorate\" vis-a-vis the number of public representatives.There is a strong case for removing the freeze on the number of seats in the delimitation exercise. Whenever there is a question of removing this freeze, which should ideally increase to about 1,000 Lok Sabha MPs, with a corresponding rise in the number of MPs in the Rajya Sabha, and state legislatures, there are various theories put forward to oppose it,\" he added.Mukherjee said any denigration of the ECI amounts to denigrating the electoral process itself. Peoples mandate is sacrosanct and has to be above any iota of reasonable doubt,\" he added.',\n",

       " 'The risk of civil collapse from nuclear weapons and the climate crisis is at a record high, according to US scientists and former officials, calling the current environment profoundly unstable.They said the rise of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns compounds both threats by keeping the public from insisting on progress.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced its symbolic doomsday clock has moved forward to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest to catastrophe that the scientists have judged the world to be at any point since its creation in 1947, at the outset of the cold war.The world needs to wake up. Our planet faces two simultaneous existential threats, said Mary Robinson, chair of an independent group of global leaders called The Elders, and the former president of Ireland and former UN high commissioner of human rights.Robinson said that countries that dont aim to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet and instead exploit fossil fuels are issuing a death sentence for humanity.She said while public pressure presents a sliver of hope for the climate, there is no such pressure on leaders to avert nuclear threats.As long as nuclear weapons are available it is inevitable they will one day be used, by accident, miscalculation or design, she said. Robert Rosner, chair of the Bulletins science and security board, said society has normalized a very dangerous world, and that information warfare is undermining the publics ability to sort out whats true and whats patently false.Sharon Squassoni, a board member and research professor at George Washington University, noted the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, which has resulted in Iran reducing compliance. And she said although some thought Donald Trumps unique approach might bring North Korea to the negotiating table, no real progress has ensued.The warning comes as nuclear arms control is in danger of dying out altogether. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty lapsed in August after the US accused Russia of cheating and Donald Trump declared he would leave the 1987 treaty altogether. The US has begun testing medium-range missiles similar to the new Russian weapon, although it is unclear where in Europe or Asia they would be based.The death of the INF leaves the New Start treaty as the last remaining limit on the US and Russian deployed strategic arsenals. It was agreed in 2010 by the then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and Barack Obama, and it expires in February 2021.It can be extended for five years and Vladimir Putin has said he is willing to agree an extension, but the Trump administration has insisted that China be included. China, whose arsenal is a 20th of the two nuclear superpowers and not as aggressively deployed, has ruled out joining in.The farthest the doomsday clock has ever been from midnight was 17 minutes at the end of the cold war.While nuclear warfare remains a threat, the climate crisis continues to intensify, as the US federal government under Trump has withdrawn from international climate efforts.Last year was the second hottest on record for the Earths surface. The 2019 average temperature was 1.1C warmer than the average between 1850 and 1900, before the ramp-up of fossil fuel use. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are on track to push that warming to 3 or 4C. The disruptions are intensifying extreme weather and expected to exacerbate poverty and global unrest.If the Earth warms by what we tend to think of as just a few degrees and human life pushes the planet into the opposite of an Ice Age  or even pushes the climate halfway there, we have no reason to be confident that such a world will remain hospitable to human civilization, said Sivan Kartha, a board member, senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute and author of the fifth and sixth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Robert Latiff, a board member and retired air force major general, said the Trump administrations disdain for expert opinion threatens action on climate change and a host of other science-based issues. New technologies and developments  from deep fake videos, to dangerous pathogens and artificial intelligence, all could threaten a fragile global peace.',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI :The Union Cabinet on Wednesday ordered closure of Hindustan Fluorocarbons (HFL), a maker of the ozone-depleting gas called hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC-22) that is used in refrigeration. Under the provisions of Montreal Protocol on phasing out of substances harmful to the layer protecting the earth, HFL is allowed to produce only 282 tonne of the gas per year from April onwards, not enough to keep the company sustainable. The government is thus left with no option but to order its closure.HFL, a subsidiary of state-owned Hindustan Organic Chemicals Limited, has its sole plant located at Rudraram in Telanganas Sangareddy district.The company has been making losses since 2013-14 and has a negative net worth. As on 31 March, 2019, it had accumulated losses of Rs.62.81 crore and a negative net worth of Rs.43.20 crore.A government release said the government will appoint NBCC (India) Ltd as a land management agency to facilitate disposal of HFL's land assets, subject to outcome Telangana governments decision on purchasing land of HFL.The government will offer a voluntary retirement scheme to all the company staff. It has set aside an interest-free loan of RS.77.20 crore for this purpose as well as payment of salary and statutory dues.

       " 'The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court that the sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir was temporary and the most important thing is consolidation of the country.The court is hearing a clutch of petitions challenging various aspects of Article 370, which was abrogated by the Centre in August last year. The five-judge Constitution bench comprises of Justices NV Ramana, SK Kaul, R Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant.Appearing for the Centre, Attorney General KK Venugopal said, In the Prem Nath Kaul judgement of 1959, these were the specific words used: On 25.10.1947, the Maharaja signed an Instrument of Accession with India which had then become an independent Dominion.He also read an excerpt from VP Menons book Integration of the Indian States (1956) to highlight the discord between Pakistan and the Maharaja. The purpose for this story of integration of the Indian states is to show the consolidation of the country. I want to show that the sovereignty of J&K was indeed temporary. We are a Union of States, Venugopal said. Menon was an Indian civil servant who was the constitutional adviser to at least three British Viceroys.The Attorney General also said that separatists were trained and sent by Pakistan to create havoc in Kashmir.The Maharaja had entered into a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and Pakistan had in fact violated this. Truckloads of tribesmen trained in combat were sent by Pakistan to overtake the state. Maharaja had asked for the aid of India due to the insurgents present in the state. There were criminal activities taking place and records even suggest that these separatists trained by Pakistan had been specially sent to create havoc, said the Attorney General.He then referred to the two past judgements of the Supreme Court - Prem Nath Kaul (1959) and Sampat Prakash (1968) - on Article 370 which had been cited by the lawyers of the petitioners to transfer the case to a larger, seven-judge bench. The Attorney General said that there is no conflict in both the judgement (on Article 370) and the case shouldnt be referred to a larger bench.On Wednesday, senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi, appearing for one of the petitioners, had told the bench that the issue needs to be referred to a larger bench as there is a dispute between two judgements which dealt with provisions of Article 370.Dealing with the Presidential orders of August 5 last year, Dwivedi had said that due to these orders issued under Article 370 (1) and (3), all provisions of the Indian Constitution have been applied to Jammu and Kashmir.This virtually abolishes the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Its a case of implied repeal where a Constitution has been repealed by an executive exercise of powers, he argued. Dwivedi said the Centre has limited powers to legislate when it comes to Jammu and Kashmir by virtue of the Instrument of Accession.Article 370 was the only tunnel of light connecting the Centre to erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Article 370 required that action of government of India should have concurrence of Jammu and Kashmir constituent assembly, which was dissolved in 1957 after framing the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, Dwivedi had said.He had said the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was not created under the Constitution of India or Article 370 and therefore J&K constitution cannot be repealed in exercise of powers under Article 370.',\n",

Terrorist attacks take a merciless toll. The nuclear menace is growing. More people have been forced from their homes by war and persecution than at any time since the Second World War. Tensions over trade and technology remain unresolved, he said.The risk of a Great Fracture is real, the UN chief noted.Second, we face an existential climate crisis, he said.Rising temperatures continue to melt records. The past decade was the hottest on record. Scientists tell us that ocean temperatures are now rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second, he said.One million species are in near-term danger of extinction. Our planet is burning, he said. Our world is edging closer to the point of no return.The third horseman is deep and growing global mistrust, said Guterres.Disquiet and discontent are churning societies from north to south. Each situation is unique, but everywhere frustration is filling the streets. More and more people are convinced globalization is not working for them, said the secretary-general.As one of our own reports revealed just yesterday, two of every three people live in countries where inequality has grown. Confidence in political establishments is going down. Young people are rising up. Women are rightly demanding equality and freedom from violence and discrimination. At the same time, fears and anxieties are spreading. Hostility against refugees and migrants is building, he said.Hatred is growing, the UN chief noted.The fourth threat is the dark side of the digital world, he said.Technological advances are moving faster than our ability to respond to - or even comprehend - them. Despite enormous benefits, new technologies are being abused to commit crimes, incite hate, fake information, oppress and exploit people and invade privacy, he said.We are not prepared for the profound impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the labor market and the very structure of society. Artificial intelligence is generating breathtaking capacities and alarming possibilities. Lethal autonomous weapons - machines with the power to kill on their own, without human judgement and accountability - are bringing us into unacceptable moral and political territory, he added.These four horsemen - epic geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology - can jeopardize every aspect of our shared future, the secretary-general warned.',\n",

Who is she, Im confused  before clarifying that he was joking.After she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us, Mnuchin added, at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it  andthe elaborate system of badgesreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations.For critics, Davos man is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is alla big waste of time.The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.Thunberg, 17, responded by tweeting a graph from a UN report showing how the worlds remaining carbon budget will be used up by 2027 unless global emissions are curbed.My gap year ends in August, but it doesnt take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1,5 carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments dont add up, she pointed out.My gap year ends in August, but it doesnt take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1,5 carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments dont add up. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/1virpuOyYGMnuchins comments expose the huge gulf that still exists between climate activists and the White House. Pressed on the climate emergency, Mnuchin insisted that environmental issues are clearly complicated.He said: When I was allowed to drive I had a Tesla. I drove in California. I liked it. But nobody focuses on how that electricity is made and what happens to the storage and the environmental issues on all these batteries.He also claimed the US was showing leadership in tackling emissions  but through its private sector rather than government. President Trump believes in clean air and water, and a clean environment, Mnuchin insisted, but also believes that more attention should be paid to the environmental damage caused by China and India.People who call for divestment should remember there are significant economic issues, issues with jobs, he continued. Many economies are transitioning to more efficient and cleaner energy. That doesnt have to be all renewables.Angela Merkel, though, spoke warmly about the work of the new generation of climate activists.The impatience of our young people is something that we should tap, the German chancellor said. In a special address to the WEF, Merkel called for more international cooperation to tackle climate change.I am totally convinced that the price of inaction will be far higher than the price of action, she declared.Thunberg has used this weeks gathering in Davos to push for radical change on the climate emergency.She called for an immediate exit from fossil fuel investment, an end to subsidies for the industry and a halt to investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments.You might think were naive but if you wont do it, you must explain to your children why youve given up on the Paris agreement goals and knowingly created a climate crisis, she told delegates on Tuesday.Mnuchins comments clearly show the White House has yet to heed the call.The US labour secretary, Eugene Scalia, called for a balanced approach. The energy sector has been an important source of jobs and fully divesting from fossil fuels would also harm US pensioners, he said.On Tuesday, Trump told Davos that delegates should be optimistic.To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.

Steps were taken to put the economy back in shape and if the government had looked at divesting these jewels (BPCL and other government companies), it would not have got a great value, added Goyal who holds the portfolios of Railways as well as Commerce and Industry.Air India has been in the red for long and the government is now in the process of finalising the contours for its disinvestment.At a meeting on June 28, 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had in-principle approved the consideration for strategic disinvestment of Air India and its five subsidiaries. It had constituted Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) for the purpose, which basically is a Group of Ministers (GoM) to handle the strategic sale of the beleaguered national carrier.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari are its members. The AISAM decided in June last year to go ahead with the process of Air Indias disinvestment.Air Indias disinvestment is likely to be completed in the next fiscal year, beginning April 1, 2020. The other companies government is looking to divest are Bharat Petroleum Corp.

Unhappy with the move, Air India employee unions met Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.

       " 'Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor are winning hearts with their cute chemistry in Remo DSouzas Street Dancer 3D, so much so that fans want them to get together in real life. During an interaction with Bollywood Hungama, Shraddha was asked to respond to a YouTube comment on the trailer of Street Dancer 3D, which urged her to get married to Varun.Thats a compliment. Its so cute, she said, adding, We have been getting that a lot, that kind of love. So we want to say thank you to the fans for appreciating us.However, Varun had a slightly different take on it. According to him, it is difficult to translate an off-screen romance into onscreen chemistry. I dont think that if people are actually very romantically inclined, they can behave like that. Maine kisi patni aur pati ko aise behave karte hue dekha nahi Pata nahi (I have never seen a husband-wife behave like this I dont know), he said.Shraddha said that when she does get married, her husband must be someone that she can be completely crack with. She said, But I have to say, whenever I get married and whoever I get married to, I have to be completely crack with that person. I have to! Its very important, for me.Also read: Can Street Dancer 3D help Varun Dhawan shed the weight of his only box office failure, Kalank?Varun and Shraddha, who are childhood friends, have earlier talked about having a crush on each other when they were in primary school.

Bachpan mein kaafi takraar hota tha, inter-school problem hota tha aur thoda-thoda chhupa hua fondness bhi tha. (Actually, our childhood story is similar to the story of the film.

       " 'Myanmar has been ordered by the United Nations highest court to prevent genocidal violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority and preserve any evidence of past crimes.In a momentous and unanimous decision, the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague imposed emergency provisional measures on the country  intervening in its domestic affairs by instructing the government of Aung San Suu Kyi to respect the requirements of the 1948 genocide convention.Declaring that there was prima facie evidence of breaches of the convention, the court warned that the estimated 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar were extremely vulnerable to attacks by the military.The ruling amounts to outright rejection of the Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyis defence of her country against accusations of systematic human rights abuses and war crimes during a three-day hearing at the ICJ last month. Even the judge nominated by Myanmar for the hearing voted against the country.The ICJs orders are binding on Myanmar and create legal obligations that must be enforced. The provisional measures imposed by the court require the government to prevent genocidal acts, ensure military and police forces do not commit genocide, preserve evidence of genocidal acts and report back on its compliance within four months.The orders are automatically sent to the UN security council, where Myanmars response will be assessed. The country receives diplomatic support from China, which is one of the five permanent members of the council.For Aung San Suu Kyi, awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1991 for non-violent democracy and human rights campaigns,the ICJ ruling ordering Myanmar to prevent genocidal violence against itsRohingyaMuslim minority marks another devastating blow to her reputation.She may have calculated, as many commentators believe, that defending her countrys reputation abroad would play well at home.Defeat at The Hague, however, could demonstrate even to her Buddhist and nationalist supporters that her authority is diminished.The ICJ only hears actions between states and does not issue warrants for arrest. There could, however, be consequences for Myanmars leaders in future.Separate claims have been lodged in both the International Criminal Court and Argentinas courts over torture and other war crimes. The interim ICJ orders preventing genocide may encourage judges elsewhere to take action against individuals.Dr Andrew Fagan, the director of Essex Universitys human rights centre, said: The ruling marks a definitive stage in Aung San Suu Kyis horrific fall from grace. Her decision to lead her countrys case in The Hague served to destroy any hope that she is anything other than a puppet of the Myanmar military. Ironically, her actions in The Hague increased her support at home, but has served to destroy any traces of international credibility she may have retained.\"Success for the Gambia at The Hague may also encourage other countries to join the action which will now progress to more detailed judicial investigative hearings. Both Canada and the Netherlands have been supportive of the initiative.Shortly before the ruling, the Financial Times published an article by her in which she admitted war crimes may have been committed against Rohingya Muslims but that refugees had exaggerated abuses against them. Owen BowcottThe case was brought to the ICJ by the Gambia, a predominantly Muslim west African state that alleges Myanmar has breached the genocide convention, which was enacted after the Holocaust.Prof Philippe Sands QC, who acted as counsel for the Gambia, said: On the cusp of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the courts clear and forceful order, which is binding, is a significant day for international law, the rights of individuals and groups, and the meaningful obligation of every state and person to desist from any act that could plausibly be characterised as genocide.The decision was read out by the court president, Abdulqawi Yusuf. Alongside him sat 16 of the 17 judges who heard the case, all wearing black robes and white lace cravats.For just over an hour, Yusuf read out the ICJs findings in a clear and deliberate speech that culminated in the courts four remarkable conclusions.Across the crowded camps in Coxs Bazar, where more than 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017, the result was welcomed by those who were able to follow the news. Internet restrictions across the camps are understood to have prevented many from doing so.Khin Maung, 24, founder of the Rohingya Youth Association, said: People are discussing and talking to each other. People did not sleep the whole night. This is one of the exciting things for us. If the court did not decide [to call for] provisional measures, our life [would have been] lost.In every way we are limited. Our children, the upcoming generation, I am very sorry there is no school for them. I am crying for that issue. There are religious leaders and community leaders talking to each other. Good news will spread quickly around the camps.Mohammed Arfaat, a Rohingya peace builder, actor and singer, described Thursday as a historic day.Before I thought we will not get back our rights and justice from the Myanmar government, he said. After a long time, Im really happy for the Gambia and other people who are doing hard work for us.Thursdays ruling dealt only with the Gambias request for provisional measures, the equivalent of a restraining order for states. The complaint is one of the first attempts to use the international justice system to help the Rohingya people. The ICJ imposed provisional measures on Serbia in relation to preventing genocide in the 1990s but this is the first time they have been unanimous and so wide-ranging. Even the ad hoc judge chosen by Myanmar expressed judgement against the country.Aung San Suu Kyis decision to attend the court in person astounded human rights groups. Once an international icon representing peaceful defiance of military dictatorship, the 74-year-old has seen her reputation plummet as she repeatedly defended her countrys army in the aftermath of the Rohingya exodus.She urged ICJ judges to dismiss allegations that Myanmar committed genocide and instead allow the countrys court martial system to deal with any human rights abuses.A Myanmar government-appointed panel, the Independent Commission of Enquiry, said on Monday it had found no evidence of genocide. Rohingya leaders have branded the investigation a whitewash.The ICJ only hears cases brought by one state against another. It has jurisdiction to hear complaints of breaches of the genocide convention even if the aggrieved state is not directly affected by violence or refugees.Dr Simon Adams, executive director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said: This is the first step on a path to justice for the Rohingya. I hope that all members of the UN security council will uphold their moral and political obligation to ensure that the provisional measures ordered by the court are fully implemented. Those responsible for genocide are still in power in Myanmar. Justice has been delayed but can no longer be denied.',\n",
       " 'Islamabad: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan backed China over the persecution of Uighur Muslims. In an interview with the German state broadcaster, Deutsche Welle Khan was asked about not being very vocal about the Chinese suppression of the Uighur people. To this, the Pakistani Prime Minister replied that the scale of what is happening in India is not comparable to what is supposedly happening to the Uighurs in China.The other reason Khan gave was that China was Pakistans great friend and helped the country in its most difficult times because of the economic crisis his government had inherited.We do talk about things with China privately, not publicly, as these are sensitive issues, Khan said.The resource-rich region in Chinas far west has a population of over 26 million people and according to Human Rights Watch, the Uighur people are forced to learn Mandarin under President Xi Jinping One China policy. Subjected to 24/7 surveillance, the Uighurs are also forced to give their DNA and biometric samples to the police.Last year, over 400 pages of classified Chinese government documents and blueprints were leaked the world media highlighting the unprecedented crackdown on the Uighur ethnic minority.Millions of Uighurs are currently imprisoned in state-run re-education camps and according to a 2017 report from Xinjiang Ministry of Justice their main aim is to wash brains, cleanse hearts, support the right, remove the wrong.Beijing has also deployed cutting edge technology by using data and artificial intelligence to keep an eye on the Uighur population. To boost this new form of social control on the masses the Chinese authorities are using mass surveillance technology to keep a close eye on the Uighurs and according to a report, after this system was operational it gave the names of thousands of Uighurs in just one week for detention or interrogation.',\n",

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - The successor to the Iranian commander killed in a U.S. drone strike would suffer the same fate if he followed a similar path by killing Americans, the U.S. special representative for Iran said, according to Asharq al-Awsat newspaper. Washington blamed General Qassem Soleimani for masterminding attacks by Iran-aligned militias on U.S. forces in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Jan. 3 drone strike in Iraq after an escalation that began last month with missile strikes that killed an American contractor, which Washington blamed on an Iranian-aligned militia in Iraq. Iran responded to the killing of Soleimani by launching missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8, although no U.S. soldiers were killed. After Soleimanis death, Tehran swiftly appointed Esmail Ghaani as the new head of the Quds Force, an elite unit in the Revolutionary Guards that handles actions abroad. Ghaani has pledged to pursue Soleimanis course. If Ghaani follows the same path of killing Americans then he will meet the same fate, U.S. envoy Brian Hook told the Arabic-language daily Asharq al-Awsat. He said in the interview in Davos, Switzerland that Trump had long made it clear that any attack on Americans or American interests would be met with a decisive response. This isnt a new threat. The president has always said that he will always respond decisively to protect American interests, Hook said. I think the Iranian regime understands now that they cannot attack America and get away with it. After his appointment, Ghaani said he would continue in this luminous path taken by Soleimani and that the goal was to drive U.S. forces out of the region, Irans long-stated policy. The U.S threat to kill Ghaani is a sign of governmental terrorism, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Thursday, according to the official IRIB news agency. These words are an official announcement and a clear unveiling of Americas targeted and governmental terrorism, Mousavi said, calling on the international community to condemn Hooks comments. The Revolutionary Guards aerospace division commander said four U.S. military bases in the region were used to deploy aircraft and drones involved in the Jan. 3 attack that killed Soleimani, including two bases in Iraq and another in Kuwait. Most of the drones had taken off from Kuwait, Amirali Hajizadeh told state television, without saying if a drone from Kuwait was ultimately responsible for the hit on Soleimani. U.S.-Iranian tensions have steadily increased since Trump withdrew the United States from Irans nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 and imposed tough news sanctions that have hammered the Iranian economy. The military flare-up began in December when rockets fired at U.S. bases in Iraq killed a U.S. contractor. Washington blamed pro-Iran militia and carried out air strikes that killed at least 25 fighters. After the militia surrounded the U.S. embassy in Baghdad for two days, Trump ordered the drone strike on Soleimani.

       " 'Tom Kohler-Cadmore accepts he was 100% in the wrong to be part of the sordid WhatsApp group that emerged during Alex Hepburns rape trial and is now trying to prevent young cricketers from doing the same.The Yorkshire batsman, 25, was among the England Lions white-ball squad that flew to Australia on Wednesday, his first outing for the second string since he and Nottinghamshires Joe Clarke were removed from a tour to India last January.It followed details of their involvement in a sexual conquest game on WhatsApp coming to light during Hepburns initial court case, with the former Worcestershire player later convicted on one count of oral rape after Aprils retrial and sentenced to five years in prison.Both Kohler-Cadmore and Clarke were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing but still reprimanded for bringing the game into disrepute. The England and Wales Cricket Board retrospectively banned them for four of the Lions games they missed, fined them 2,000 each and ordered them to attend an educational course.With that punishment now served, Kohler-Cadmore has returned to the Lions set-up after another strong season at Headingley  the ECB insists Clarkes continued absence is based solely on performance  and he appears keen to own his mistake.Kohler-Cadmore said: One hundred per cent I was in the wrong. We all had our part to play in the group and it was meant as a bit of a joke. I know its not a joke now but it was never meant to be malicious.They were my actions, I was part of it and I was the one that created the group. It was never meant to have any outcome like that, it was just us three being young, single lads. We were naive.Kohler-Cadmore knows his proximity to the Hepburn case is not something I am ever going to get away from but insists he is a reformed character these days, having feared his career was crashing down when Andy Flower, the former Lions head coach, initially stood him down from the India tour 12 months ago.He said: I 100% respect the ECBs decision, I know I was in the wrong, and it was a stupid mistake. I thought it was quite a fair punishment for me, and the rehabilitation course I went on, I felt its given me more knowledge on the area.The learning from it was that it was about you as a whole. You cant allow yourself to be acting in that way, you have got to conduct yourself a lot better.Since then my life has had a proper U-turn in how I conduct myself. I have actually taken myself out of every WhatsApp group I could possibly be in. I am more than happy to miss out on that because I dont want the risk of being affiliated with something that I cant control.I have done a talk with the Yorkshire academy guys, using my mistakes to try to stop someone else getting into a similar situation  be it social media or their own private WhatsApps, whatever. [I am] trying to make a positive out of what was a negative situation.The Professional Cricketers Association responded to the Hepburn case by rolling out a series of relevant courses to all 18 counties and the England mens and womens teams. Players have been taught about sexual consent and the law, as well as having attitudes challenged.Kohler-Cadmore has also volunteered to speak at the PCA rookie camp at Edgbaston on 25 February, where around 50 newly signed professional cricketers will hear his cautionary tale as part of their induction into the sport.He added: If I could save [the PCA] having to support someone in that kind of situation, because I had spoken about it, it would be a good thing to come from a terrible situation.',\n",

The 30-year-old father and a 49-year-old relative identified in redacted court records as the homeowner and an aunt were also taken in for questioning.Police initially said the cause of the childrens deaths had yet to be determined and there were no obvious signs of trauma.A probable cause statement filed in court by police and later made public said Henry had admitted to deliberately smothering each child - two girls, aged 7 months and a year, and a 3-year-old boy - starting with the older daughter.It was not immediately clear if Henry had an attorney.The probable cause statement filed by police said Henry confessed to placing her hands over the nose and mouth of the victims until each stopped breathing, and she described smothering the 1-year-old while the girls brother looked on, yelling at his mother to stop and punching her to no avail.She recounted smothering the 3-year-old next, straddling him on the floor of a bedroom as she sang to the child and he tried scratching and pinching her until he died, according to the probable cause statement. It said she then fed her 7-month-old daughter a bottle before smothering her, again while singing to the infant.Afterward, according to the statement, Henry placed all three children on the living room couch as if they were taking a nap without telling either of the two other adults in the house what had happened. Police said they went to the home on Monday night after responding to an emergency call from a relative inside and found the three children who were pronounced dead at the scene.Police offered no possible motive for the killings, but court records cited one of the other adults in the house as having told police that Henry had a methamphetamine addiction and had been acting strange the past several days.Fortune said the family recently moved to Arizona from Oklahoma.',\n",

I dont think these rapists should be hanged quietly. What is the point of capital punishment, if you cannot set an example? They should be hanged in public, she said.Jaising had tweeted earlier, While I fully identify with the pain of Asha Devi I urge her to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini and said she didnt not want the death penalty for her .

       " 'Former minister P Chidambaram on Thursday blamed the NDA government for the worlds largest democracy dropping 10 places in Democracy Indexs global ranking, accusing the ruling BJP-led government of debilitating democratic institutions and eroding democracy.The Democracy Index  prepared by The Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis division of The Economist Group  provides a snapshot of the state of democracy in 160-plus countries.Indias overall score, on a scale of 0-10, fell from 7.23 in 2018 to 6.90 in 2019, with the survey listing India among countries where there were regressions.India was ranked 51st.Chidambaram responded to the report, underlining that anyone who has closely observed the events of the last two years knows that democracy has been eroded and democratic institutions have been debilitated.Those who are in power are the real tukde tukde gang, Chidambaram said, delivering his punch line.Tukde tukde gang is a colloquial term often used by right-wing parties to attack the Left-backed groups and their supporters. BJP leaders have also used the term, coined after the February 2016 protests in Jawaharlal Nehru University during which, it is alleged, the term was first used by people saying they would break India into pieces (tukde tukde means pieces).The Democracy Index referred to the changes in Jammu and Kashmir and the controversial implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam while describing what it termed as said was a democratic regression in India, the worlds largest democracy.The Indian government stripped the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) state of its special status by repealing two key constitutional provisions granting it powers of autonomy, the report said.',\n",
       " 'Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Friday unveiled his partys new flag which is saffron-coloured, symbolising his partys drift towards the Hindutva ideology. Thackerays son Amit also entered the political arena at the party conclave. The flag has a rajmudra (seal) of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with the partys name below it. The old MNS flag has three colours  saffron, green and blue.The new flag was unveiled at the first maha-adhiveshan or conclave of the party at Goregoan.Inaugurating the conclave, Raj Thackeray paid tribute to his mentor and Shiv Sena chief late Bal Thackeray as it is his birth anniversary. The MNS had, for the first time, kept a photograph of Veer Savarkar on the stage, another sign of the partys Hindutva shift as Savarkar is considered to be a Hindutva ideologue. Thackerays son Amit  was also  introduced as a leader of the party at the conclave. After a series of defeats in successive elections, Raj Thackeray is now trying to reinvent his party. The MNS has just one legislator in the Maharashtra Assembly and a lone corporator in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). There have also been speculations of an alliance between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the MNS following Thackerays meeting with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis earlier this month though the BJP leader said there was no scope for a tie-up.There is a difference in the ideologies of the MNS and BJP. There is no scope for an alliance. It is not possible until our ideologies are different. We can consider it in the future, if the MNS changes its ideology, Fadnavis had said after the meeting.

       " 'Days after a senior Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP) officer was arrested for escorting terrorists to safety, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has decided to take charge of all transfers and postings of JKP personnel, including  junior postings such as that of  Station House Officers (SHO), a senior government  official said on condition of anonymity. In addition, the MHA will now directly involve itself with the operational effectiveness of the police force in the region  and capacity building of JKP.JKP Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh, posted with the critical anti-hijacking wing at the Srinagar airport,  was arrested on January 11 when he was trying to escort two wanted Hizbul Mujahedeen (HM)  terrorists, Naveed Babu and Rafi Rather. He has since claimed that he was working on an undercover operation to eliminate the senior leadership of HM in the valley. Initial investigations of JKP, however, have not found any evidence to this effect. The case is now being investigated by the National Investigation Agency.  MHAs move is significant. Even after the regions bifurcation into two union territories, J&K, and Ladakh, it chose to restrict itself to taking a call on  senior positions in JKP; decisions on the transfers and postings of junior officers  were left to the discretion of the local government.Now, according to the person cited in the first instance,  MHA has issued fresh orders asking that all postings of even  station house officers  must be made after informing the MHA. R R Bhatnagar,  the recently appointed advisor to the Lieutenant Governor, has been allocated responsibility for this. The order says, Bhatnagar,  who headed the Central Reserve Police Force till recently  will suggest appropriate measures for effective policing and intelligence gathering for effective policing at the police station level including the reshuffling of Station House Officers and other cutting edge levels in consultation with the Special Security Advisor, (MHA). HT has seen a copy of the order.Singh,  who was about to be promoted, has told interrogators that he has been part of covert operations for several security agencies operating in Jammu and Kashmir for many  years. The claims are being verified, a second senior official who did not want to be named said.

       " 'Harvey Weinstein went on trial Wednesday in a landmark moment for the # MeToo movement, with prosecutors painting him as a sexual predator who used his Hollywood clout to abuse women for decades, while his lawyers sought to portray his accusers as willing participants.Prosecutor Meghan Hast told the jury of seven men and five women that the former studio boss was not just a titan in Hollywood  he was a rapist who screamed at one victim that she owed him sex, used injections to induce an erection before an assault and pushed his way into the apartment of another woman and attacked her.It is for his complete lack of empathy that he must be held accountable, Hast said.Also read:Can Street Dancer 3D help Varun Dhawan shed the weight of his only box office failure, Kalank?Weinstein lawyer Damon Cheronis countered by laying out plans to use friendly-sounding emails, calendar entries and other evidence to call into question the accusers accounts of being attacked.The opening of the rape trial more than two years after a barrage of allegations against Weinstein gave rise to the #MeToo movement was seen by activists as a milestone in the global reckoning over sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinsteins lawyers have portrayed the case as the result of a climate of accusation run amok.Weinstein has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. He could get life in prison if convicted.Weinstein, 67, told reporters he felt very confident about the case as he left court: I got great lawyers.While he entered the courthouse without the walker he has been using lately because of back problems, he was leaning on it again as he left.The once-powerful and feared executive brought to the screen such Oscar-winning movies as Pulp Fiction, The Kings Speech, Shakespeare in Love and Chicago and hobnobbed with the elite in Hollywood and beyond, a point prosecutors made by showing jurors a photo of Weinstein with former President Bill Clinton. A prosecutor also told the judge that Weinstein had taken calls from Clinton while Weinstein was with one of his accusers.Weinsteins lawyers later cited the photo in asking for a mistrial, saying the image was irrelevant and accusing prosecutors of improperly trying to influence the jury. Judge James Burke denied the request.Scores of women have accused Weinstein of exploiting his position as a career-maker to sexually harass or assault them over the years. But the New York charges center on two allegations: that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haleyi in his apartment in 2006 and raped an aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they come forward publicly.The rape accuser found a needle in the hotel room bathroom after the alleged assault and realized Weinstein had injected himself to get an erection, Hast said.Another time, after the woman told him she had a new boyfriend, Weinstein dragged her into a bedroom, all the while screaming at her that he owed her one more time, Hast said. He ripped her jeans off so forcefully that it left scratch marks.The prosecutor said Weinstein later told the woman, I just want to apologize for what happened earlier. I just find you so attractive, I couldnt resist you.In addition to the two women he is charged with attacking, prosecutors plan to call to the stand four other accusers -- including actress Annabella Sciorra  in a bid to show a pattern of predatory behavior by Weinstein.They will each describe their fear, their shame and their humiliation  the struggle each went through to push their trauma down and show a brave face to the world, Hast said.With Sciorra expected to take the stand Thursday, Hast detailed allegations that Weinstein sexually assaulted the Sopranos actress around 1993 after giving her a ride home to her Manhattan apartment and forcing his way inside.She told him to get out. She told him no. But Harvey Weinstein was undeterred, Hast said. She said the actress eventually stopped fighting Weinstein, hoping it would end, and was left emotionally and physically destroyed, passed out on the floor.Weinsteins lawyers made clear they intend to go on the offensive.Cheronis said the 2013 rape accuser sent Weinstein a request that year asking for time privately with him and another message letting him know, I got a new number. I just wanted you to have it.  Always good to hear your voice.Cherinos said: These arent our words. Theyre hers. It is not a relationship based on fear. You are going to see that.Later Wednesday, testimony got underway with prosecutors calling to the stand former Weinstein Co. board member Lance Maerov, who described the ex-producer as an extremely influential, powerful person who could be charming in public and aggressive in private.I would say his public personality was diametrically opposed to who he was in private, Maerov said. The movie company went bankrupt after Weinsteins fall.While Weinsteins trial got rolling, another judge in the same courthouse set an April 21 date for Cuba Gooding Jr.s trial on charges of groping three women without their consent at New York City bars. The Oscar-winning Jerry Maguire actor has denied wrongdoing, and his lawyer has argued its a case of #MeToo-minded overreach.Follow @htshowbiz for more',\n",

       " 'New Delhi: In a shocking development, a man accused of rape was acquitted by a Delhi court arguing that no offence was made against the accused as he was married to the woman when he forcibly established sexual contact.The court of Additional Sessions Judge Umed Singh Grewal observed, \"The victim had accused the man of raping her in July 2016, but no charges are made against him as the complainant was married to the man on that day.\"\"The victim had married the accused on or before November 2, 2016. According to the victim\\'s cross-examination, the accused raped her after July 5, 2016 when she was married to the man,\" the court further observed.The woman had been living in Punjab with the accused when she came to know about him being convicted and jailed in a theft case.Later she came to Delhi without informing him. After the man was released, he followed the woman to Delhi and convinced her to end the dispute between them and started to live together. He also reportedly stole Rs 2 lakh from the woman.After this incident, the woman refused to live with the accused. The court concurred that the physical relationship between the couple was with the consent of the woman when they were living in Punjab and some time in Delhi. \"And it was only after the theft of Rs 2 lakh that the man established forcible physical relation with the woman,\" said the court added.According to the court, when the man forcibly established sexual relations with the woman, the complainant was his wife and thus a case is not made out.',\n",
       " 'India again took on Pakistan at the United Nations for raking up the Kashmir issue at the international forum. Indias Deputy Permanent Representative to UN Nagaraj Naidu said Pakistan spews venom and propagates false narratives.Just like a fish takes to water, one delegation has again taken to hate speech. Every time this delegation speaks, it spews venom and false narratives of monumental proportions, Naidu said at a session of the UN General Assembly on Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization.Pakistans practice of using false pretenses to distract from addressing malaise that afflicts it has run its course. Pakistan needs to reflect that there are no takers for its false rhetoric and should get down to normal business of diplomacy, he added.Naidu further added that instead of putting an end to the vitriolic diatribe, the delegation indulges in confabulations and obfuscates the international community from the truth.The Indian diplomats strong response came after Saad Ahmed Warraich, Counsellor at Pakistan mission to the UN, raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in his remarks during the session, saying no other situation reflects the abdication of the UNs responsibility to discharge its responsibilities more than the decades-old Jammu and Kashmir issue.Earlier this month, India had flayed Pakistan for trying to raise the Kashmir issue in the UNSC with the help of his all weather ally China. India said the failed bid was a desperate measure to peddle baseless allegations.Attempt was made by Pakistan, through a UNSC member, to misuse the platform. Overwhelming majority of UNSC was of view that UNSC was not the right forum for such issues and it should be discussed bilaterally, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.He had also said that Pakistan can avoid such global embarrassments by refraining from such acts in future.China and Pakistan tried, for the third time, to raise the Kashmir issue at the United Nations but the efforts were thwarted by Indias diplomatic allies who left Beijing isolated, according to officials aware of the development. The attempt failed as other member countries felt Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.China got a stinging response when it raised Kashmir at a closed-door informal consultation of the UN Security Council (UNSC), Syed Akbaruddin, the Indian envoy to the UN, said on Twitter.',\n",

       " ' A war memorial that is being planned in Meerut is set to feature a heroine who lost her life in a counter-insurgency operation in Kashmir in 2016. It is also likely to feature some others who acquitted themselves creditably in the Kargil war India fought with Pakistan in 1999.What makes the memorial unique is that it is devoted to service animals, mostly dogs, but also horses and mules. It will be the countrys first  animal war memorial  and recognise heroics on the battlefield, devotion to duty and outstanding contribution to military service alongside soldiers, three senior officers said, asking not to be named.The memorial will come up at the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) Centre and College in Meerut where the army breeds, rears, and trains dogs, mules and horses.Approval from the defence ministry is expected soon to construct a war memorial to commemorate RVC animals and men who have sacrificed their lives or have been commended for exceptional gallantry or distinguished service. Land has already been identified in Meerut and the preliminary design has been frozen, said one of the officers.He added that  the monument would be similar to the National War Memorial in Delhi but on a smaller scale.The names and service numbers of more than 300 dogs, 350 handlers and a few horses and mules will be inscribed on granite tablets at the memorial. The dogs include around 25  killed in action during counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the countrys North-east, the first officer said. It will be a befitting token of remembrance and a mark of respect and gratitude towards the RVC soldiers (men and animals) who laid down their lives for the country. Several western nations have memorials dedicated to animals, said the second officer.Topping the list of animals whose names will be inscribed on the memorials walls is Mansi, a Labrador who was posthumously mentioned in dispatches (the highest honour that a dog can get in military service in India) four years ago for her role in a counter-infiltration operation in north Kashmir, the second officer added.Her handler, Bashir Ahmed War,  was also posthumously awarded Sena Medal for gallantry and his name will be alongside Mansis. The highest award won by a dog handler is the Shaurya Chakra, the countrys third highest peacetime gallantry award.The army has more than 1,000 dogs, 5,000 mules and 1,500 horses.Five Labradors were awarded commendation cards on Army Day 2020 for helping soldiers track down terrorists in J&K and sniffing out deadly explosives in the North-east last year.Army dogs are trained for a variety of roles, such as detecting mines and explosives,  tracking, assault, infantry patrol, and search and rescue.Explosives detection dogs are an invaluable component of road opening parties that safeguard the movement of men and material in terror hotbeds. These dogs have saved innumerable lives by timely detection of explosives. Mine detection dogs are used along the Line of Control to create safe lanes, said the third officer.The RVC pioneered war dog training in India in the late 1950s. Labradors, German Shepherds and Belgian Shepherds (Malinois) are the mainstay of the armys canine work force. The RVC has introduced some Mudhol Hounds (an indigenous dog breed from Karnataka) and Cocker Spaniels on a trial basis for explosives detection.Recognising the contribution of animals, the army in 2017 named an officers mess lounge in Delhi cantonment after the longest serving army mule, Pedongi, who carried military loads in forward areas for over 30 years.The armys animal transport units, equipped with mules, are assigned the responsibility of supporting some of its remotest outposts located at heights of up to 19,000 feet. Mules played a crucial role during the 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan.',\n",
       " 'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hong Kongs Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) will allow all crew members and frontline employees to wear surgical masks due to concerns over a new coronavirus, and said passengers to and from Wuhan, China, could change or cancel flights for free through March 31. The airline had earlier said only cabin crew operating mainland China flights could wear masks, in response to the airlines flight attendants calling for permission to wear masks on all flights globally as cases have also been confirmed in the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Due to the evolving information from health authorities, we will allow crew members and frontline airport employees to wear surgical face masks when on duty at their discretion, Cathay said in a statement. The coronavirus outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, struck as millions of Chinese prepared to travel for the Lunar New Year, heightening contagion risks. Wuhans local government said it would close all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from the city as of 10 a.m. on Thursday (0200 GMT), state media reported, adding that the government said citizens should not leave the city unless there were special circumstances. The Cathay Pacific Airways Flight Attendants Union said on Tuesday it had received a tremendous amount of emails and messages from members concerned over catching the virus given they are exposed to over 300 passengers from numerous places on a single flight. On Wednesday evening, Cathay said on its website that rebooking, rerouting and refund charges would be waived for all tickets booked on or before Jan. 21, arriving to or departing from Wuhan through March 31, an extension from the Feb. 15 date listed the prior evening. Deaths from Chinas new flu-like virus rose to 17 on Wednesday, with more than 540 cases confirmed. The virus has already spread beyond Wuhan to population centers including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong. Cathay said that as required by the Hong Kong health authorities, it was distributing health declaration forms and will be making face masks and antiseptic wipes available at the boarding gate to passengers traveling from Wuhan to Hong Kong. Our frontline staff are reminded to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene, and to remain alert and vigilant while being on the lookout for passengers presenting with infectious disease symptoms, the airline said. Cathay has already been hit by plummeting demand as a result of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, leading it to cut capacity and defer the delivery of four planes. Shares in Cathay have fallen by 10% since the start of January as the virus spread. Jefferies analysts said shares in Cathay and mainland Chinese carriers could remain under pressure for some time if the coronavirus situation paralleled the 2003 SARS outbreak and cases continued to increase. That coronavirus outbreak killed nearly 800 people.

       " \"UN experts are demanding an immediate investigation by the US into evidence indicating that Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Washington Post, was hacked with spyware deployed in a WhatsApp message sent from the personal account of Saudi Arabias crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.The special rapporteurs  Agns Callamard and David Kaye  said in a joint statement they were gravely concerned by evidence they had reviewed about the apparent surveillance of Bezos in what they described as a possible effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Posts reporting on Saudi Arabia.The statement was released after the Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Bezos, who is chief executive of Amazon and the worlds richest man, appeared to have had his mobile phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a message apparently sent from the personal WhatsApp account of Prince Mohammed.In one of the most extraordinary disclosures, the UN rapporteurs said that, according to forensic analysis, the crown prince sent WhatsApp messages to Bezos, in November 2018 and February 2019, in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos personal life that was not available from public sources.Founder and CEO of Amazon, Bezos is the world's richest man.

On Tuesday, she was due to release a statement into the alleged hacking of Bezos's phone.Callamardconfirmed to the Guardian she was still pursuing 'several leads' into the murder, but declined to comment on the alleged Bezos link.An annexe to their report provided further details of an alleged incident in November 2018 when a single photograph was texted to Bezos from the crown princes WhatsApp account along with a sardonic caption. The image, according to the UN rapporteurs, was of a woman resembling the woman with whom Bezos is having an affair, months before the Bezos affair was known publicly.Two months later, in January 2019, the National Enquirer published a special edition that exposed the affair. AMI, which owns the US supermarket tabloid, has denied any third party was involved in influencing its reporting.In a day of dramatic developments that threatened to deepen the crisis for Saudi Arabia, the UN rapporteurs: Released details of advanced technical analysis that established grounds for a reasonable belief that Bezos was the victim of intrusive surveillance via hacking of his phone as a result of actions attributable to the WhatsApp account used by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Said Bezoss iPhone was believed to have been infected by malware on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from the crown prince. Within hours of receipt of the MP4 video file, a huge exfiltration of data began. The amount of data leaving the phone increased enormously and continued undetected for several months. Alleged that the most likely explanation for the huge amount of data exiting the phone was that it had been infiltrated by spyware such as that developed by NSO Group, a private Israeli surveillance company. The assessment was attributed to expert analysis of likelihood of cyberweapons. NSO immediately denied involvement, saying: We can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance. Issued a stark warning to prominent attendees of the World Economic Forum at Davos, several of whom are known to have recently met with the crown prince. Callamard said she wanted to raise the alarm for people around the world who have had dealings with Saudi Arabia about the fragility of their electronic systems.Speaking to the Guardian about the Davos agenda, Callamard said: I am disappointed the organisers did not put any emphasis on the question of surveillance on their agenda. She added: They are all extremely vulnerable.She said the revelation that the future king of Saudi Arabia might have had a personal involvement in the targeting of the billionaire owner of the Washington Post should put a renewed spotlight on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist, was killed in October 2018, five months after the alleged hack of Bezoss iPhone.Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS, becomes crown prince of Saudi Arabia, designated heir to the king.Donald Trump hosts a private White House dinner for a western adviser to MBS andDavid Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), whichpublishes the National Enquirer.Mohammed bin Salman meets with David Pecker and the western adviser to the crown prince, in Saudi Arabia.Mohammed bin Salmanreportedly tells a top aidehe wants to use a 'bullet' on Jamal Khashoggi, who is writing critical columns in the Washington Post.Mohammed bin Salman arrives in the US for a tour to boost Saudi Arabia's reputation with America's most senior VIPs, business leaders and government officials.Trump hosts Mohammed bin Salman at a meeting in the White House, where the US president calls them 'good friends'.AMI publishes nearly-100-page glossy magazine praising Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin Salman.Mohammed bin Salman is guest of honour at Hollywood dinner.

The crown prince denies any involvement in the killing.Callamard said she had previously stopped short of making determinations about the precise nature of Prince Mohammeds involvement in the Khashoggi murder.But the latest information, if correct, placed the crown prince at the heart of a campaign of surveillance and hacking, she said.Prior to the release of the UN statement on the suspected hacking, Saudi Arabia had dismissed the Guardians reports about the apparent involvement of the kingdoms heir as absurd.The kingdoms embassy in Washington said: We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out.Callamard and Kaye, who is the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, also provided more information about the apparent nature of the surveillance of Bezoss iPhone, saying technical experts had assessed with medium to high confidence that it was infiltrated via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account used by the crown prince.According to a detailed timeline provided by the UN rapporteurs, Bezos met with Prince Mohammed at a small dinner in Los Angeles on 4 April 2018. The pair exchanged phone numbers that correspond to their WhatsApp accounts, the UN experts said.Weeks later, on 1 May, a message was sent from the crown princes WhatsApp account to Bezos, the UN explained.The message is an encrypted video file, the UN timeline states. It is later established, with reasonable certainty, that the videos downloader infects Mr Bezos phone with malicious code.Within hours of receipt of the malicious file, the technical analysis indicated a massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data from the billionaires phone which continued for several more months.In their statement, the UN rapporteurs said: The circumstances and timing of the hacking and surveillance of Bezos also strengthen support for further investigation by US and other relevant authorities of the allegations that the crown prince ordered, incited, or, at a minimum, was aware of planning for but failed to stop the mission that fatally targeted Mr Khashoggi in Istanbul.At a time when Saudi Arabia was supposedly investigating the killing of Mr Khashoggi, and prosecuting those it deemed responsible, it was clandestinely waging a massive online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post.WhatsApp is currently suing NSO. The Facebook-owned messaging company accuses NSO of being behind secret attacks on more than 100 human rights activists, lawyers, journalists and academics.NSO has in the past vigorously defended itself against the WhatApp lawsuit, and has said repeatedly that its signature surveillance software, which is known as Pegasus, is used solely as a law enforcement tool that could help prevent crime and terrorist attacks.In a statement released on Wednesday the company said it was shocked and appalled by the report of the hacking of Bezoss phone but insisted our technology was not used.It said: If this story is true, then it deserves a full investigation by all bodies providing such services to assure that their systems have not been used in this abuse. Just as we stated when these stories first surfaced months ago, we can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance.According to the UN special rapporteurs, the Saudi Royal Guard acquired from NSO Group its Pegasus spyware in November 2017 and it is believed to have been involved in the targeting of Saudi dissidents. Their statement said: The hacking of Mr Bezos phone occurred during a period, May-June 2018, in which the phones of two close associates of Jamal Khashoggi, Yahya Assiri and Omar Abdulaziz, were also hacked, allegedly using the Pegasus malware.The UN rapporteurs added: Surveillance through digital means must be subjected to the most rigorous control, including by judicial authorities and national and international export control regimes, to protect against the ease of its abuse. It underscores the pressing need for a moratorium on the global sale and transfer of private surveillance technology.Have you got new information about this story?

       " '(Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares surged on Wednesday, and the company became the first publicly listed U.S. automaker to cross $100 billion in market valuation, more than Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co combined. Shares of the electric carmaker were  up 8.1% at $591.78 in late morning trading, continuing their furious rally that has more than doubled the share price in the last three months. It speaks to the inflection in electric vehicle demand globally, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email. The skeptics have been proven wrong, and the $100 billion market cap is sending the bears into hibernation mode.  The milestone comes less than a month after Teslas stock crossed $420, the price at which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted he would take the electric-car maker private. Musk tweeted he had funding secured to take the company private in August 2018, when its shares were trading in the mid-$330s, only to later give up under investor pressure and regulatory concerns. The liquidity concern for now is off the table, and that opens up the ... base to new investors, said Ben Kallo, senior research analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., which on Jan. 9 downgraded its rating on the stock to neutral. A higher stock price also helps attract employee talent, Kallo said. In a technology sector where it is very hard to recruit and retain employees, especially in the Bay Area, the stock price helps.  Teslas market value also puts Musk a step closer to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package. The $100 billion market capitalization needs to stay for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock. The recent rally in Teslas shares was fueled by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries. In a bullish report Wednesday, Wedbush analysts said that robust demand in China and Europe alongside aggressive trajectory of Gigafactory 3 production will boost fourth-quarter earnings. Wedbush has a neutral rating on the stock.  Tesla is set to report its earnings on Jan. 29 after markets close.

       " 'Donald Trump tweeted his way to a record on Wednesday.The extremely online US president tweeted 131 times between 12am and 4.46pm ET, according to Factbase, a platform that tracks data about Trump. That number includes 36 original tweets and 110 retweets, making the day his most active on the account since he became president.The social media rampage came as Trump traveled back to the US from Davos in Switzerland, and as the US Senate was addressing his impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.Trump has been an avid Twitter user throughout his presidency, tweeting out typos like covfefe, sharing a quote from Mussolini that had been attributed to Trump himself, and reportedly firing the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson by tweet.Most of Trumps retweets on Wednesday included arguments in his defense in the impeachment trial. One retweet of the House Republicans stated that House Democrats working to impeach Trump dont have the evidence and dont have the facts. Others touted his successes as president. One from the Republican congressman Ron Wright stated that Trump had added 145,000 new jobs in December and 2.1m jobs in 2019.Not the Senates job to mop up the mess made in the House by the Democrats. Biden admitted that he went to Ukraine and did the Quid Pro Quo. @SteveScalise @FoxNewsTrump also sent out commentary quoted from Fox News regarding the trial and commented on the 2020 election, saying it is rigged against candidate Bernie Sanders. In one tweet he called candidate Tom Steyer a major loser. He retweeted another calling New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a barely literate moron.Despite breaking his own record on Wednesday, Trump did not tweet as frequently as he has in the past. His record for most tweets per hour was set from 7-8 am EST on 12 December 2019 at 58 tweets  or one tweet every 62 seconds. The Davos Twitter storm seen today represented just one tweet per 88 seconds, according to Factbase.As of 6pm EST, Trump is continuing to tweet and is approaching his all-time record of 161 tweets, set in 2015 before he was president.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump under way, U.S. senators have polished their talking points about upholding the Constitution. They also have another phrase at the ready: Please do not touch me. Senate impeachment trials are rare and historic - the one unfolding now is only the third in the nations history - and with them come security jitters in and around the Capitol building. A large metal detector has been erected in the Senate workspace for reporters, and the press will be herded into velvet-roped holding pens outside the Senate chamber at certain times - a notable change from the normal rules of engagement on Capitol Hill, where journalists are largely free to roam the hallways to interview lawmakers. Reporters have protested the tighter controls. Besides pesky reporters, the senators who will serve as jurors in the impeachment trial will be on the lookout for aggressive protesters in Senate office buildings adjacent to the Capitol. Lawmakers faced similar tensions in October 2018, when the Senate considered the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual assault. At least one senator was impeded by protesters at an elevator.  This time, the sergeant-at-arms has distributed a card to all 100 senators that contains these phrases to defuse a confrontation from hostile passersby:   - Please move out of my way  - You are preventing me from doing my job  - Please excuse me, I am trying to get to the Senate floor  - Please excuse me, I need to get to a hearing/meeting  - Please do not touch me  If those do not do the trick, the beleaguered senator can always shout: Help, Police!

       " 'SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreas first transgender soldier said on Wednesday she would sue the military after it announced it would dismiss her for undergoing gender reassignment surgery last year. Byun Hui-su, who holds the rank of staff sergeant and is stationed in Gyeonggi Province, north of Seoul, had the operation in Thailand last year while on leave, and had expressed hope of continuing to serve in the female corps. In her first public appearance since her case was publicized last week, Byun said she would pursue a lawsuit against the army, all the way to the countrys highest court if necessary. I will continue to fight until the day I can remain to serve in the army, she said. Ill challenge the decision until the end, to the Supreme Court. The army said in a statement that while it will make efforts to protect soldiers human rights and prevent discrimination, the surgery left Byun unable to continue to serve.  Byun broke down in tears as she described the decision to undergo surgery after suffering from gender dysphoria, which medical experts define as distress from the internal conflict between physical gender and gender identity. It was an extremely difficult decision to let my base know of my identity, but once I did, I felt much better, she told reporters at a news conference in Seoul after the military announced its decision. I thought I would finish serving in the army and then go through the transition surgery and then reenter the army as a female soldier. But my depression got too severe. One army official with knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that there should be no reason for the military to deny Byun if she reapplied to serve in the female corps after completing the legal process to formally become a woman.  A human rights organization had filed a petition with a national human rights watchdog urging the army to postpone its decision until after Byun had completed the court process, but the army said that legal proceeding is irrelevant to its personnel decisions. The case has triggered debate over the treatment of transgender troops and soldiers from the wider LBGT community in the country, which requires all able-bodied men to serve for around two years. Byun said she still hopes to serve in the military in the future. Apart from my gender identity, I want to show everyone that I can also be one of the great soldiers who protect this country.

       " 'Terry Jones, a founding member of the anarchic Monty Python troupe who was hailed by a colleague as the complete Renaissance comedian,\" has died after a battle with dementia. Jones\\'s family said the 77-year-old died Tuesday evening at his home in London. In a statement, his family said he died after a long, extremely brave but always good humoured battle with a rare form of dementia, FTD.Jones\\'s wife, Anna Soderstrom, and children Bill, Sally and Siri, said we have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades.His work with Monty Python, his books, films, television programs, poems and other work will live on forever, a fitting legacy to a true polymath, they said.Born in Wales in 1942, Jones attended Oxford University, where he began writing and performing with fellow student Michael Palin. After leaving university, he wrote for seminal 1960s comedy series including The Frost Report and Do Not Adjust Your Set. At the end of the decade he, Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Terry Gilliam formed Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus, whose surreal, irreverent humour helped revolutionise British comedy.Jones wrote and performed for the troupe\\'s early-70s TV series and films including Monty Python and the Holy Grail in 1975 and Monty Python\\'s Life of Brian in 1979.Playing the mother of Brian, a hapless young man who is mistaken for Jesus, he delivered one of the Pythons\\' most famous lines: \"He\\'s not the Messiah. He\\'s a very naughty boy!As well as performing, Jones co-directed Holy Grail with Gilliam, and directed Life of Brian and the 1983 Python film The Meaning of Life.After the troupe largely disbanded in the 1980s, Jones wrote books on medieval and ancient history, presented documentaries, directed films, wrote poetry and wrote the script for the Jim Henson-directed fantasy film Labyrinth.In 2016 he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, which gradually robbed him of the ability to write and speak. (He) was one of my closest, most valued friends. He was kind, generous, supportive and passionate about living life to the full, Palin said in a statement.He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation. He was the complete Renaissance comedian  writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children\\'s author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have, Palin said.Jones is survived by his wife, his ex-wife Alison Telfer, and three children.Follow @htshowbiz for more',\n",

Mishra submitted his nomination on Tuesday with much fanfare.A letter signed by AAPs national secretary, Pankaj Gupta claims that the returning officer has accepted Mishras nomination forms despite the absence of the mandatory No-Dues certificate pertaining to electricity,water and telephone expenses incurred during stay at a government accommodation.Also Watch l Delhi Elections 2020 l Bijli-paani-school or CAA, Modi: Whatll Delhi vote on?AAPs letter posted by the news agency claims Mishra has been staying in a government accommodation for the last 10 years and must furnish the certificate as per the guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India.There is no official word on the dispute yet from the election commission, which had set Wednesday aside for the scrutiny of nominations. Before filing his nomination, Mishra took out a roadshow attended by BJP heavyweight, Chandni Chowk MP and Union minister Harsh Vardhan.There is no love lost between Mishra and his former political outfit, the AAP, since Mishras bitter ouster from the party.Mishra has promised to win Model Town seat for the BJP. AAPs Akhilesh Pati Tripathi is the two-time sitting MLA from the north Delhi constituency and has been fielded again from the seat.

PM 2.5 particles can include dust, soot and smoke and are so small they can lodge deep in the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Students get affected a lot by air pollution because they are exposing to outdoor all the time even waiting for the bus or just walking, Panpimon Jumsook, a teacher at one of the schools said. Like many growing Asian cities, Bangkok is plagued by vehicle fumes, dust from construction sites and emissions from industry but the burning of stubble and undergrowth in fields in surrounding rural areas is believed to contribute to much higher pollution levels in the dry, winter months. Bangkoks air quality index (AQI) on Wednesday was 163, according to data from AirVisual. Anything above 150 is considered unhealthy. The schools will be closed for one day. Last January, the city closed schools for a week because of pollution.

       " 'PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo and Serbia agreed on Monday to launch direct commercial flights after a two-decade interval in a deal mediated by the United States in an attempt to push the two former foes closer to normalizing relations. Direct flights were halted in 1998 when war broke out in Kosovo between ethnic Albanian insurgents and Serbian security forces. Serbia lost control of Kosovo after NATO bombing in 1999 to drive out Serb forces, ending a counter-insurgency in which more than 13,000 people, mainly Kosovo Albanians, were killed. Mondays deal was signed at the U.S. embassy in Berlin. This event marks another step in our efforts to normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia, Kosovo President Hashim Thaci said in a statement. Thaci said the deal was reached with the contribution of the U.S. President Donald Trumps national security adviser, Robert OBrien, and U.S. ambassador to Berlin, Richard Grenell. Grenell was appointed by Trump in October last year as special envoy for talks between Belgrade and Pristina. President Donald Trump once again led us to an historic victory, Grenell wrote on his twitter account. There were no details on when the flights would start but officials in Kosovo said that Eurowings, a low-cost company owned by Lufthansa, would be involved. The road distance from Pristina to Belgrade is 350 km (218 miles), around four hours by car. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed the deal. NATO has some 4,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo and is responsible for the control of Kosovos airspace. This is an important step which will make the circulation of people and goods easier and faster within the Western Balkans region, Stoltenberg said in a statement. Kosovo has now been recognized by more than 110 countries including the United States, but not by Serbia, Russia or China. The United States and the EU have encouraged Serbia and Kosovo to normalize relations. If they do, Kosovo would be able to apply for membership of the United Nations, a move that Serbias old ally Russia is currently blocking. Talks between Kosovo and Serbia to normalize relations came to a halt in November 2018 when Kosovo introduced a 100 percent tax on goods produced in Serbia. Belgrade, which still considers Kosovo as part of its territory, said it will not return in the negotiating table until the tariffs are lifted. Kosovos two biggest parties are still struggling to reach a deal on forming a new government which, when formed, is widely expected to lift the tariffs. Marko Djuric, head of the Serbian government office for Kosovo, said the flights would not start if the tariffs arent lifted. Reporting by Fatos Bytyci; editing by Nick Macfie',\n",

       " 'The Hawaii congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is suing Hillary Clinton for defamation, alleging the 2016 nominee described her as a Russian asset and claiming more than $50m in damages.Gabbard, who sued Google in July 2019, also claiming $50m, filed the lawsuit in the southern district of New York. She claims that in October 2019 Clinton falsely stated that Gabbard is a Russian asset.Clintons false assertions were made in a deliberate attempt to derail Tulsis presidential campaign, the filing says.The lawsuit claims: The defamatory statements have caused Tulsi to lose potential donors and potential voters who heard the defamatory statements. Tulsi has suffered significant actual damages, personally and professionally, that are estimated to exceed $50m  and continue to this day.Gabbards allegations stem from an interview Clinton conducted with the Democratic strategist, author and podcaster David Plouffe in October 2019. Discussing the 2020 primary field, Clinton said of one candidate: She is a favourite of the Russians.They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. And, thats assuming Jill Stein [the Green Party nominee for president in 2016, who received favourable coverage from Russian state media] will give it up, which she might not because shes also a Russian asset. Yeah, shes a Russian asset.Some observers say Stein cost Clinton victory over Donald Trump in key states in 2016. Such claims are fiercely debated.A Clinton spokesman confirmed that Clinton was talking about Gabbard.Before the interview, the New York Times reported that Gabbard had supportive signs from the Russian state news media, and said a hashtag supporting her appeared to be amplified by a coordinated network of bot-like accounts. The Times said there was no evidence of coordination between these networks and Gabbards campaign.Gabbard claimed Clinton had said she was being groomed by the Russians. Though a number of media organisations did report that Clinton made that accusation, media factcheckers discredited Gabbards interpretation of Clintons statement about Russia, with the Washington Post awarding her three Pinocchios.Gabbards lawsuit brushes over the grooming claim, focusing instead on the alleged damage of the Russian asset remark.Tulsi is not a Russian asset, the filing says. No one  Russia or anyone else  controls her or her presidential campaign.The lawsuit claims Clinton made the remark in retribution for Gabbard supporting Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary and describes Clinton as a cut-throat politician who has never forgotten this perceived slight.At the time, Gabbard was in her second term in the House and was a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee.Gabbard sued Google in 2019, claiming the company suspended her campaigns advertising after the first Democratic debate in June. A hearing is reportedly set for 27 January.There is little evidence Clintons comments have had any impact on Gabbards popularity. According to Real Clear Politics, the congresswoman was polling at 2.3% nationally at the time of the remarks. She currently has 1.7% of stated preferences.',\n",

The government also wants the top court to introduce a time limit for filing of review and curative petitions in such cases.The Centre requested the top court to amend its 2014 verdict in the Shatrughan Chauhan case where it had taken a dim view of the executive keeping mercy petitions on hold for years and ruled that this wait for a torture for the convicts. The top court had also taken a dim view of the secret executions by the state and ordered jail authorities to ensure that there was a 14-day gap between the rejection of their mercy pleas and their hanging. Retribution has no constitutional value in our largest democratic country, the judges had ruled.In its application, the Union Home Ministry asked the top court to mandate that convicts had to file a curative petition within a specified period and could only file a mercy petition within 7 days of the death warrant being issued.It also asked the Supreme Court to order all courts and state governments to issue death warrants within seven days of the President rejecting the mercy petitions and to execute them within seven days, irrespective of the status of any petition that the convict may file.It is submitted that while taking care of the rights of the convicts, it is more important and need of the hour to lay down guidelines in the interest of the victims, their families and in larger public interest, lest the convicts found to be guilty of such horrible, and dreadful, cruel, abominable, ghastly, gruesome and heinous offences would be permitted to play with the majesty of law and prolonged the execution of the sentence awarded to them in accordance with the law.It is more important and need of the hour to lay down guidelines in the interest of the victims, the home ministry said, reasoning that otherwise the convicts would be permitted to play with the majesty of law.The home ministry said the guidelines spelt out by the Supreme Court in 2014 were accused centric and did not account for the trauma, agony, upheaval and derangement of the victims and their family.It is found several years before and after the judgment in the Shatrughan that convicts of even such heinous crimes under the garb of Article 21 take the judicial process for a ride, it said.The Centres request comes against the backdrop of the delay in the hanging of the four men convicted for the 2012 Delhi gang rape because they had not exhausted their legal options.Only one of the four convicts has filed a mercy petition, which has been rejected. The other three are entitled to file one before February 1 when a death warrant issued against them will be executed.',\n",

Sakellaropoulou, 64, has been president of the Council of State, Greeces top administrative court. She will succeed Prokopis Pavlopoulos, whose five-year term expires in March.  In an unusual demonstration of harmony in the fractious world of Greek politics, the conservative party nominee was backed by opposition parties, including the leftist Syriza party which lost power in an election last July. She was backed by 261 MPs in the 300-member parliament. Sakellaropoulou, from the northern city of Thessaloniki, became the first female head of the Council of State in 2018, supported for that position by the then leftist government.  A divorcee who lives in central Athens and is active on social media, Sakellaropoulou has written numerous papers on environmental protection and chairs a society on environmental law. She is also an avid cat-lover. For decades, failure by parliament to elect a president in Greece could lead to a snap election. Following a recent reform, the process to select a president can go up to five voting rounds in parliament with the threshold starting at 200 votes and gradually falling to the majority of those present in the room.

       " 'DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called climate activists like Greta Thunberg prophets of doom at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. By Wednesday he was lamenting not having watched the teenage activists speech. The gentler tone, along with a promise to join a plan to plant one trillion trees, hinted at a different approach from the U.S. president, who in the past has dismissed climate change as fake news and told Thunberg she needs anger management. Either way, the first two days of the annual Davos gathering were dominated by the back-and-forth between the 73-year-old former businessman and the 17-year-old campaigner, with corporate leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as words, there was a need for concrete decisions. Thunberg doubled down at Davos. Our house is still on fire, the Swede said, decrying the empty words and promises of leaders and their message that children  millions of whom have joined Thunbergs Friday protests around the world  should not worry. Your inaction is fuelling the flames, she said. On Wednesday, she met Britains Prince Charles, 71, a life-long environmentalist who tries to keep out of politics. Everything I have tried to do, and urge, over the past fifty years has been done with our children and grandchildren in mind, Charles said shortly before sitting down with Thunberg. He said he did not want to be accused by his descendants of doing nothing except prevaricate and deny the problem. Now, of course, they are accusing us of exactly that. Trump and the British heir to the throne did not cross paths, but as he left the mountain resort, Trump told reporters he would have liked to have heard Thunberg speak. Business leaders suggested Trump had been listening. Asked if he had convinced Trump to join the trillion trees initiative, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff paused and smiled before telling Reuters many people were involved. And Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of German giant Siemens, told Reuters he had advised Trump to listen to young activists. We have to sit together and involve them in dialogue, he said he had told the U.S. president. Asked by reporters if he still thought climate change was a hoax, Trump responded: No, not at all.  But he said Thunberg should shift her attention away from the United States to focus on other, more polluted countries. You have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you cant believe ... I think Greta ought to focus on those places, he said. Other leaders sought to draw a middle ground between Trump and Thunberg. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said the Europeans were leading with a different approach. There exists a third way between Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg, he told reporters.  Theres no need to fall into extremes, between those who say either that there is no problem with global warming or those who lament that nothing has been done to combat it, because its not true  there are things that have been done. Mark Carney, the outgoing head of the Bank of England who will shortly become a United Nations envoy for climate policy, praised Thunberg for raising awareness of climate change. There are those who will be out front in the transition and those who lag. And thats different than a binary green-good, everything else brown-bad, he said. There should be fifty shades of green, if not more.  Additional reporting by Balazs Koranyi in Davos; Editing by Leela de Kretser, Alex Richardson and Alexander Smith',\n",

They alleged that Vale hid information about the dams instability to avoid hurting the companys reputation, and TV SD issued reports saying it was safe.The object of these omissions was to avoid any negative reputational impacts to Vale that could affect its market value, the prosecutor William Garcia told reporters on Tuesday. TV SD and Vale systematically concealed from society, shareholders and investors the real gravity of the situation.Schvartsman, the former Vale CEO, acted directly to create this false impression of complete safety in Vales dams, Garcia said.Police detective Eduardo Figueiredo praised the work of teams which recovered and identified the victims shattered bodies. This was fundamental for the investigations, he said.In separate statements, TV SD, Vale and a representative for Schvartsman told Reuters it was premature to assign fault for the rupture, given that other prosecutorial bodies were still looking into the matter.V SD said it was deeply affected by the tragic collapse of the dam and added: The causes of the dam breach have still not been conclusively clarified.Vale said it would review all the details of the charges, adding that it found the fraud accusation perplexing.It is important to note that other authorities are investigating the case and, at this point, it is premature to claim there was conscious assumption of risk to cause a deliberate breach of the dam, the company said.The Guardian reported in February that workers had repaired a leak at the dam months before it broke but Vale failed to alert staff or move a canteen or administrative centre destroyed by the tidal wave of mud. In an email comment, a Vale spokeswoman stated that there was no leak in the dam.The charges come amid widespread frustration in Brazil over the justice systems failure to punish anybody over a similar disaster four years earlier in the same state.Another tailings dam operated by Samarco  a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton  collapsed in November 2015, killing 19 people and causing an environmental catastrophe. Prosecutors investigating the disaster have said Samarco was aware the dam was unstable, but so far, nobody has been convicted or imprisoned.',\n",
       " 'Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said India is working on ways to have fairer and more equitable terms in its trade relationships with various countries.Speaking here at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2020, the commerce and industry minister also called for greater cooperation among various nations to realize the huge growth prospects in the Indian Ocean region and also for tackling the important issue of climate change.Goyal said RCEP in its present form was clearly an unworkable agreement. Any pact needs to take into account several factors. India is grappling with a huge trade deficit, particularly with China and many other nations in the region,\" he said.For the first time, India demonstrated that trade cannot be dictated by diplomacy, Goyal said, referring to Indias decision to pull out of the RCEP.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has had to factor in several diversities among partners, but India has serious concerns about climate change and is seeking greater cooperation on fair terms, he asserted.Goyal was speaking at a Strategic Outlook session on The Indian Ocean Rim.We are like a pivot for the Indian Ocean and we believe this region has huge potential. At the same time, India is very much concerned about the issue of climate change.Going forward, the entire grouping around the Indian Ocean will play a very important role, while keeping in mind fair and equitable distribution. India also expects greater cooperation among various nations on climate change,\" he said.Goyal further said, We in India are also working on how to put in place more equitable terms in our trade relations with various countries.\" The Indian Ocean Rim sees two-thirds of the worlds oil shipments pass through its waters and is home to half of the worlds container ships that support 2.7 billion people.The panellists discussed the strategic priorities for the Indian Ocean Rim in 2020, including advancing regional cooperation, strengthening the blue economy and mitigating climate change.The panellists included Samir Saran, president, Observer Research Foundation (ORF), Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer DP World Limited; Mathias Cormann, Minister for Finance; Leader of the Government in the Senate of Australia; and Njoki Njehu, Director, Daughters of Mumbi Global Resource Center, Kenya.Goyal also said India has contributed the least to global warming but is still being very responsible on fossil fuels, while the western world is not doing enough even after accounting for more than half of the carbon emissions.The commerce minister added that India is committed to safeguarding the interest of its people while welcoming investors from across the world by making regulations easier for them.When it comes to governance and easing regulations, India was at a disadvantageous position for many years but a conscious decision was made soon after our government came to remove all those legacy issues and to make the growth story equitable for all,\" the minister for railways as well as commerce and industry said.We want to provide right opportunities for our people and at the same time safeguard the interests of the investors as well.We are always trying to make India more investor friendly and we are talking to our friends across the world on how to improve our infrastructure. We are showcasing infrastructure projects in various countries to get the best from them,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'Apple Inc. suppliers plan to begin assembling a new low-cost iPhone in February, people familiar with the plan said, as the company looks to address a wider swath of the global smartphone market ahead of its 5G handsets later this year.The Cupertino, California-based company is expected to officially unveil the new phone as early as March, one person familiar with its road map said. The assembly work for the new handset will be split among Hon Hai Precision Industry, Pegatron Corp. and Wistron Corp., the people added.This will be the first lower-cost iPhone model since the iPhone SE. It will look similar to the iPhone 8 from 2017 and include a 4.7-inch screen, Bloomberg News has previously reported. The iPhone 8 is still on the market, currently selling for $449, whereas Apple sold the iPhone SE for $399 when that handset launched in 2016.The new phone is expected to have Touch ID built into the home button, reusing established Apple technology instead of opting for an in-display fingerprint sensor like most modern Android rivals. It will not have Apples Face ID biometric authentication, but it will feature the same processor as Apples current flagship device, the iPhone 11.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Apples more affordable iPhones have proven popular with consumers, including the latest iPhone 11, whose starting price was $50 lower than Apples typical pricing. Strong demand for iPhones has prompted Apple to ask Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to make more chips in the current quarter, according to two people familiar with the matter.Apple is planning a slew of new high-end iPhones for release later in 2020 that include 5G connectivity, faster processors, and new 3-D cameras on the back, Bloomberg News has reported.A cheaper offering may help Apple better compete in the most price-competitive and fast-growing emerging phone markets, particularly India. iPhones are still a hard sell in the country, which is overrun by aggressively-priced Android rivals coming in at less than $200. Still, Apple has shown a will to carve out a niche for itself and is eyeing locations for Apple stores within its borders.The U.S. tech juggernaut is hoping its handset shipments will return to growth this year, having set itself the goal of shipping more than 200 million units in 2020. The successor to the iPhone SE will play a significant role in that task.',\n",

       " 'India dropped 10 places in the Democracy Indexs global ranking to 51st place, with the survey describing the erosion of civil liberties in the country as the primary cause of the democratic regression.The Democracy Index - prepared by Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis division of The Economist Group - provides a snapshot of the state of democracy worldwide in 165 independent states and two territories.It is based on electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, political culture and civil liberties.Indias overall score, on a scale of 0-10, fell from 7.23 in 2018 to 6.90 in 2019, with the survey listing India among countries where there were regressions. In the Asia and Australia region, India ranked eighth, behind countries such as Timor-Leste, Malaysia and Taiwan.By contrast, Norway topped the index, with a score of 9.87, while North Korea was at the bottom of the global rankings, with a score of 1.08. Chinas score fell to 2.26, and it is now ranked 153rd, close to the bottom of the rankings.The Democracy Index described 2019 as a tumultuous year for Asian democracies. The biggest change occurred in Thailand, whose score improved by 1.69 points compared with 2018, to 6.32, resulting in a rise of 38 places, while introduction of a fake news law in Singapore led to a deterioration in the score for civil liberties.The Democracy Index referred to the changes in Jammu and Kashmir and the controversial implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam while describing what it said was the democratic regression in India, the worlds largest democracy.The Indian government stripped the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) state of its special status by repealing two key constitutional provisions granting it powers of autonomy, it said, referring to Article 370 of the Constitution and Article 35A, which prevented residents from other states from purchasing land or property in Kashmir.Following the removal of these provisions of the Constitution and the passage of a new Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019, J&K no longer enjoys statehood and is now divided into two union territories: one that retains the name Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, it said.Ahead of the move, the government deployed a large number of troops in J&K, imposed various other security measures and placed local leaders under house arrest, including those with pro-India credentials. The government also restricted internet access in the state, it added.The Democracy Index noted that the citizenship registration exercise in Assam had excluded 1.9m from the final list of the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The vast majority of people excluded from the NRC are Muslims, it said, adding the ruling BJP says that most of the people excluded from the list are immigrants from Bangladesh, whose government denies this.It added: Critics claim that the exercise targets the Muslim population and will lead to demographic changes along religious lines. There are almost 200m Muslims in India: the figure was 195,810,000 in 2015, representing 14.9% of the total population of India and 10.5% of the total Muslim population of the world... At current growth rates India will be home to the worlds biggest Muslim population by 2060, with a Muslim population of more than 333m or 19.4% of the total population.The new citizenship law has enraged the large Muslim population, stoked communal tensions and generated large protests in major cities.Three countries - Chile, France and Portugal - moved from the flawed democracy category to the full democracy category, while Malta moved in the opposite direction, falling out of full democracy to become a flawed democracy.',\n",

       " 'The Duke and Duchess of Sussex began their new lives in Canada by firing a warning shot across the bows of the media over paparazzi photographs they said were taken without consent.Within hours of Prince Harry touching down in Vancouver to join Meghan and their baby son, Archie, the couples lawyers were threatening legal action over pictures taken of the Duchess of Sussex while out for a stroll.The images, which were published by some UK outlets, showed the duchess walking in a public park on Vancouver Island. She was carrying Archie in a baby sling, while walking the couples two dogs, and was accompanied by two bodyguards.Lawyers claim the photographs were taken without her consent by photographers hiding in bushes.Harrys arrival on Vancouver Island came just days after the couple reached an agreement with the Queen that will result in them leaving official royal duties for a financially independent future.It was the first time the family has been reunited since it was announced they would drop their royal titles, repay the 2.4m public costs for the refurbishment of their Windsor home, and stop receiving money from the sovereign grant.Speaking at a private dinner in London for his charity Sentebale on Sunday, Harry said he had not taken the decision to give up his official royal duties lightly, but there was no other option.What I want to make clear is were not walking away, and we certainly arent walking away from you, he said. Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations without public funding. Unfortunately that wasnt possible.The couple has previously complained about their treatment by the British press. In his speech, Harry referred to the media as a powerful force, appearing to lay the blame for the couples departure at least partly at its feet. The Queen, in her statement released on Saturday, acknowledged the intense scrutiny the couple had been subjected to.Meghan began legal proceedings against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday in October after the paper published extracts of a letter she had sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. At the same time, Harry issued a statement denouncing the medias bullying of his wife, which he likened to the treatment of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.As the couple begin a period of transition, questions over who will fund their security remain unanswered. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told Sky News there must be a line of delineation over who funds the security costs of the Sussexes.I think there is an issue about how public money is spent. Quite clearly there have already been arrangements made about how that family are going to live and how they are going to be able to get private income but there clearly has to be a line of delineation.I think we all want a family like that to be safe, but at the same time I think what really needs to happen is they need to understand how their lifestyle is to adapt and what their needs might be.Pressed on whether the UK taxpayer should foot the bill while they are in Canada, he said: I dont have an easy answer to that, I dont know at the moment what precisely their arrangements are going to be.I am, of course, concerned to make sure that taxpayers money is used effectively in order to provide protection to people who are offering a service to the British public.',\n",
       " 'Indian governments proposal to restrict imported liquor sales at duty free shops in airports to one bottle per passenger would lead to a loss of around  650 crore revenues for airport operators, likely leading to a steep hike in user charges for travelers, Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) said in a statement on Tuesday.The proposal has been made by the Commerce Ministry to the Finance Ministry ahead of the union budget with an eye on reducing the trade deficit. The Union Budget is set to be unveiled by the finance minister on 1 February.The move to restrict import of liquor along with a complete ban on cigarettes through duty free shops will have a disastrous effect on the Indian civil aviation sector, including airports, airlines, passengers and duty free operators, APAO said in a statement.The proposal to restrict alcohol sale at duty free shops will further increase aeronautical charges at airports by at least  200 crore annually, which will lead to higher air ticket price, the airport operators added.\"At most Indian airports, duty free revenues make up 15%-20% of the total non-aeronautical revenues and sales of liquor and cigarettes together account for over 75%-80% of overall Duty Free sales and to make up the revenue loss on account of these new restrictions, the Aeronautical Charges will have to increase which will have to be borne by airlines and passengers,\" APAO said.The proposal will have an impact on ticket prices and may even impact the growth in passenger traffic, which is already extremely subdued,\" it said. Moreover, the revenue loss could also impact the financial performances of Indian airports including their credit ratings and ability to raise funding for future expansion. The move comes even as the government is in the midst of a program to privatize a number of airports.The proposal to restrict quota of alcohol sale at duty free shops in airports is also likely to impact state-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI), which operates the largest number of airports in the country.\"It is estimated that AAI would lose over Rs. 330 crores (Rs. 180 Crores from its operations and Rs. 150 crores due to reduction in revenue share payments from DIAL and MIAL),\" APAO said.\"This will reduce AAI\\'s ability to develop airports in remote and rural areas, upgrade airport infrastructure and regional connectivity which is hallmark of the NCAP 2016,\" it added.Liquor makers have also strongly objected the move and said it would have a deep impact on their business..\"The annual value of airport duty free business is close to $350 Millions, much of the revenue is received by airport operator. Almost all the international airports earn revenue from rentals to duty free shops and it supports the economic viability of the airport and development of infrastructure,\" said R V Subramanian, Director of Ian Macleod Distillers India Pvt Ltd, in a letter to the finance minister on 20 January.A copy of the letter has been reviewed by Mint.Subramanian told Mint that if the Commerce ministry\\'s proposal is implemented, liquor sales at duty free shops in Indian airports will halve.\"Currently sales through such shops in India is worth around $500 million. The margin for airport operators is around $300 million. Our sales will go down if the proposal goes through,\" he said.\"I think the user development charges that passengers have to pay would also go up. We have also set up an SEZ (special Economic Zone) at NOIDA for exclusive sales to duty free shops. That business will be severely affected,\" he said.Amrit Kiran Singh, executive chairman of International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), said if implemented the policy will have close to zero impact on the revenue etc. of an economy of the size of India,\" but will dent the business sentiment.He highlighted that duty free is an additional channel for business which the government should encourage in its efforts to re-energize the economy. The proposed move of reducing the duty free allowance from 2 Litres to 1 Litre will break the back of this channel as over 75% of this channel is contributed by alcoholic beverages.(Shuchi Bansal contributed to the story)',\n",

       " 'There were two rookie coaches hopping around on the touchline and both will feel they have spent a lifetime in management after this emotional rollercoaster. While Frank Lampard seethed at Chelseas lack of conviction at both ends of the pitch, Mikel Arteta wondered what on earth he is going to do with Shkodran Mustafi and marvelled at the fearlessness of Gabriel Martinelli. It was that sort of night, absorbing and bonkers in equal measure, and in the end it was difficult to know whether to focus on Chelseas sense of bewilderment or Arsenals joy.For Lampard, the twist was tough to take but easy to explain. Chelsea played for more than an hour against 10 men, led twice and still dropped more points at home. They lacked creativity again, bolstering the argument that they need attacking reinforcements before the transfer window closes, and paid for their carelessness when Martinelli, an 18-year-old winger with a wonderfully direct style, hauled Arsenal level with a stunning solo goal just after the hour.Chelseas imprecision is hurting their push for Champions League qualification  fifth-placed Manchester United will go three points behind them if they beat Burnley at home on Wednesday  and it spoke volumes that they were incapable of holding on after Csar Azipilicueta restored their lead with six minutes left. Lampards side are too loose and Kepa Arrizabalagas indifferent form was captured by the moment when Hctor Bellern, cutting on to his left foot, rescued a point for Arsenal with a shot that somehow squirmed beyond Chelseas goalkeeper.Arrizabalaga has conceded too many soft goals this season but Arteta was entitled to argue Arsenal merited a draw after a show of defiance in the second half. His side stood up to be counted after Mustafis disastrous error led to David Luizs red card on 26 minutes. Granit Xhaka excelled as a makeshift centre-half, Martinelli ran Azpilicueta ragged on the left and Arteta, who has lost only one of his seven games, was delighted with his new sides spirit on a ground where they have suffered in the past.Initially David Luiz was the story against his old side. There was no respectful celebration from the Brazilian when he scored here for Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League tie in 2015 and he looked to make his presence felt from the start, attracting the ire of the Chelsea fans when he charged into the back of Tammy Abraham and kneed the striker up the backside. Battle lines had been drawn.Abraham would have the last laugh, though David Luizs dismissal owed much to the brainlessness of Mustafi. While there have been signs of progress under Arteta, the fact remains the Spaniard has inherited a squad containing a multitude of weaknesses. There is only so much Arteta can improve with his work on the training ground and that was underlined by Mustafis blunder.After a promising opening Chelsea simply had to wait for Arsenals most unreliable player to self-destruct. Abraham had fooled Mustafi with a clever turn before scoring his sides late winner at the Emirates last month and this time he was in the right place when the centre-half sold Bernd Leno horribly short with a staggeringly incompetent back-pass. Abraham raced away, rounded Leno and went down following a desperate lunge from David Luiz.Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot and how the Chelsea fans chortled when they saw the referee reaching for his red card. David Luiz had denied Abraham a clear goalscoring opportunity and he departed with mocking chants ringing in his ears. All that was left was for Jorginho to tuck his penalty away, giving Chelsea a lead their enterprising football deserved.Yet Lampard, who hopes to beat Atltico Madrid to the signing of PSGs Edinson Cavani, would despair at Chelseas inability to kill the game. While Callum Hudson-Odoi tested Leno with a rasping drive, they struggled to make the most of their numerical advantage. They lost their shape in midfield, where NGolo Kant had a disappointing game, and allowed Arsenals belief to grow.The hosts flirted with disaster early in the second half, Arrizabalga almost playing Jorginho into trouble. Chelseas game management was dismal and Arsenal, who looked blunt at first without the suspended Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, equalised in the 63rd minute. A Chelsea corner was cleared, Martinelli took possession in his own half, outpaced Emerson, raced clear after a slip from Kant and slipped the ball past Arrizabalaga.Lampard turned away in disgust. Chelsea are an infuriating side and they did not convince even after Azpilicueta turned Hudson-Odois cross past Leno. Arsenal fought and Lampard struggled to understand why his players turned down opportunities to put the ball out of play when Abraham went down with an ankle injury. The move progressed, Bellern drove inside and the Arsenal right-backs tame shot left Lampard fuming.',\n",

She recalled, Mental illness happened to me when I had least expected it. I was at a professional high, my movies were doing great and I was in an amazing relationship. Everything was going just perfect. One morning when I woke up and I felt all was well, I fainted. Luckily the house help came and saw me on the floor. I was taken to a doctor and I was told it was nothing and probably just some blood pressure fluctuation or something like physical tiredness. Those were the first physical signs. For a long time, I just felt like sleeping, not going out, not meeting people.She went on to add, Luckily, my mother had come to my place and when my parents were packing, I just started crying. She asked me what was it and I had no answer. At that time, my mother told me that I probably needed professional help and thats how I began consulting a psychiatrist.Deepika said she and her family initially didnt feel like telling everyone and letting media know about it. After I was diagnosed with a clinical depression regarding my mental health, I had to even lie when someone asked me how was I doing. I would say, Im great, though I was actually terrible, she said.She went on to add, As I began on my path of recovery, I also understood the stigma attached with the mental health and the need to go public with it. Imagine what would have happened, if my mother had not said that I should a professional help for my problem. I felt that I should do something to help others with their signs and symptoms and that was the reason for going public with my illness and then setting up the Live Love Laugh foundation.Also read: Priyanka Chopra at WEF, Davos: I want my kids to grow up in a world where the world leaders have listened to Gretas generationStressing on the need to be more aware about mental illness, she said, Are you feeling sadness and a low for a long period of time? You need to understand sadness is transient and depression is for a long period of time. It is very important to share with somebody around you about how you are feeling. It is also important that the people around you dont dismiss it as attention-seeking or some small thing. It is important for caregivers to encourage people to seek help. She also spoke about how in our country, parents are not comfortable with taking their children for professional help. At times, it is other way round too when parents want to take, but children do not want to seek medical help or consultation. I want every person experiencing mental illnesses to know that you are not alone - because there are no obvious physical symptoms. You feel like you are the only one going though this, and it comes with a lot of guilt, she said.  For humanity, she said that people must realise that there are some fundamental things that need to change such as a notion that men are not supposed to have mental illness.

       " 'The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced the first known case of a new strain of coronavirus in the US. In a Tuesday press conference, a CDC spokesman said a US citizen returning from a trip to central China had been diagnosed in Seattle.According to the CDC, the man is in his 30s and is in good condition at a hospital in Everett, Washington after returning to the area last week.While in China, the man traveled to the Wuhan area, where the virus is believed to originate. It has since spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai.The US is the fifth country to report a case of the illness. Nearly 300 cases have been reported in China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. US authorities have begun screening air passengers coming from central China.The virus is officially calledSars-CoV-2 and this causes the disease Covid-19. It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples  severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus can causepneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Chinas national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outsideChina, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend.There are nine cases of the virus in the UK. Four were located in Brighton, one in London. At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative. Of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.We dont yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we wont know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about400,000 deathseach year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. TheNHS advisesthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GPs surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is the worldwide spread of a disease. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHOs list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a window of opportunity to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Sarah BoseleyHealth editor andHannah DevlinLast month, health officials began reporting new cases of viral pneumonia, including symptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Officials connected the patients to a food market in Wuhan.So far there are six reported deaths, all in China. Most were 60 or older and had a previous medical condition. Although the virus likely originated from animal-to-people contact, Chinese officials this week confirmed their first case of person-to-person contraction.CDC officials said the risk to the American public is low. According to Reuters, officials around the world have implement similar screenings to contain the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season.',\n",

       " 'Pakistans leadership has limited options to respond to Indias decision on Jammu and Kashmir as many analysts view that Islamabad has little credibility on the issue given its long history of covertly supporting militant groups there, according to a US Congressional report.The Congressional Research Service (CRS) in its second report on Kashmir in less than six months also said that Pakistans ability to alter the status quo through military action has been reduced in recent years, meaning that Islamabad likely must rely primarily on diplomacy.CRS is the independent research wing of the US Congress which prepares periodic reports on issues of interest for US lawmakers so that they can take informed decisions inside the Congress. Currently, two resolutions are pending in the House of Representatives, one of which is being sponsored by Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.Also Watch | Donald Trump calls Imran Khan good friend, says talking about Kashmir In its report dated January 13, CRS said that post August 5, Pakistan appeared diplomatically isolated, with Turkey being the only country to offer solid and explicit support for Islamabads position.Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmirs special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories on August 5, evoking strong reactions from Islamabad.Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue. However, India has maintained that the move was entirely an internal matter.The 25-page report said that Pakistan called for a UNSC session and, with Chinas support, the Council met on August 16 to discuss Kashmir for the first time in more than five decades, albeit in a closed-door session that produced no formal statement.Many analysts view Islamabad as having little credibility on Kashmir, given its long history of covertly supporting militant groups there. Pakistans leadership has limited options to respond to Indias actions, and renewed Pakistani support for Kashmiri militancy likely would be costly internationally, it said.Pakistans ability to alter the status quo through military action has been reduced in recent years, meaning that Islamabad likely must rely primarily on diplomacy, the CRS said.Given also that Pakistan and its primary ally, China, enjoy limited international credibility on human rights issues, Islamabad may stand by and hope that self-inflicted damage caused by New Delhis own policies in Kashmir and, more recently, on citizenship laws, will harm Indias reputation and perhaps undercut its recent diplomatic gains with Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, it said.According to CRS, the long-standing US position on Kashmir is that the issue should be settled through negotiations between India and Pakistan while taking into consideration the wishes of the Kashmiri people.The Trump Administration has called for peace and respect for human rights in the region, but its criticisms have been relatively muted, it noted.With key US diplomatic posts vacant, some observers worry that the US governments capacity to address South Asian instability is thin, and the US Presidents July offer to mediate on Kashmir may have contributed to the timing of New Delhis moves, it said.The United States seeks to balance pursuit of a broad US-India partnership while upholding human rights protections, as well as maintaining cooperative relations with Pakistan, the report said.CRS said that following Indias August 2019 actions, numerous Members of the US Congress went on record in support of Kashmiri human rights. H.Res. 745, introduced in December and currently with 40 co-sponsors, urges the Indian government to end the restrictions on communications in Jammu and Kashmir, it said.An October hearing on human rights in South Asia held by the House Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation included extensive discussion of developments in Jammu and Kashmir. In November, the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission held an event titled Jammu and Kashmir in Context.  US policy, it said, seeks to prevent conflict between India and Pakistan from escalating, and the US Congress supports a US-India strategic partnership that has been underway since 2005, while also maintaining attention on issues of human rights and religious freedom.CRS in its report told lawmakers that over the past decade, Washington appears to have grown closer to India while relations with Pakistan appear to continue to be viewed as clouded by mistrust.The Trump Administration suspended security assistance to Pakistan in 2018 and has significantly reduced non-military aid while simultaneously deepening ties with New Delhi. It views India as a key anchor of its free and open Indo-Pacific strategy, which some argue is aimed at China, it said.Yet any US impulse to tilt toward India is to some extent offset by Islamabads current, and by most accounts vital, role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation negotiations. President Trumps apparent bonhomie with Pakistans prime minister and offer to mediate on Kashmir in July was taken by some as a new and potentially unwise strategic shift, it said.  ',\n",
       " 'SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.N. experts have demanded an immediate investigation by U.S. and other authorities into allegations that Saudi Arabias crown prince was involved in a plot to hack the phone of Amazon boss and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. The U.N. special rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, said on Wednesday they had information pointing to the possible involvement of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the alleged 2018 cyberattack, which preceded alleged threats by the National Enquirer to publish intimate photographs of the billionaire tech tycoon.  Callamard, the special rapporteur for extra-judicial killings, and Kaye, special rapporteur for free expression, said in a statement that they believed the hack was carried out in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Posts reporting on Saudi Arabia and called for an immediate investigation by U.S. and other relevant authorities. Their recommendation is not binding, and how quickly - if at all - U.S. officials might act on it was not immediately clear. The Wall Street Journal said an FBI investigation into the hack was ongoing.  The bureau declined to comment.  Saudi officials dismissed the allegations as absurd. The rapporteurs based their call for an investigation on a 17-page forensic report drawn up by Washington-based FTI Consulting, which a source familiar with the matter said had been commissioned by Bezos. The report alleges with medium to high confidence that the billionaires iPhone X was hijacked by a malicious video file sent from a WhatsApp account used by the crown prince on May 1, 2018. The report, a copy of which was first published by Motherboard, said that within hours of receiving the video file there was an anomalous and extreme change in the devices behavior, with the level of outgoing data from the phone jumping nearly 300-fold. FTI Consulting said in an email that its work was confidential and it would not comment further. The allegations could further damage relations between Bezos and Riyadh and risk harming the kingdoms reputation with foreign powers and investors. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) declined to comment. The hacking is said to have taken place months before the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the crown prince. The CIA believes that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing of Khashoggi, sources told Reuters here weeks later. He was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi agents and his body dismembered. Prince Mohammed, or MbS, said last year that the killing was carried out by rogue operatives and that he did not order it. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud dismissed the allegations of the princes involvement in any phone hack of Bezos. I think absurd is exactly the right word, he told Reuters in an interview in Davos. The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos phone is absolutely silly. Saudi Arabias U.S. embassy also dismissed the allegations. We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out, it said in a message posted on Twitter. On Twitter, Bezos published a photograph of himself at a service for Khashoggi with a single word: Jamal. The special rapporteurs, who released their findings in a statement, report to the United Nations Human Rights Council but are independent watchdogs and not U.N. officials. They stopped short of identifying which specific technology might have been used in the alleged hack, but said software like that made by Israeli company NSO Group or Italian spyware maker Hacking Team could potentially have been deployed. NSO denied its technology was used in the alleged hack. We know this because of how our software works and our technology cannot be used on U.S. phone numbers, it said. Our products are only used to investigate terror and serious crime. After a merger last year, Hacking Team is now part of Swiss-Italian cyber intelligence firm Memento Labs. Memento Labs head, Paolo Lezzi, was not immediately available to comment but has previously said he has no knowledge of Hacking Teams former operations. The alleged hack deepens the intrigue around how the Enquirer - which had close links with U.S. President Donald Trump at the time of the alleged extortion - obtained messages exchanged between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, an ex-TV anchor who the tabloid said he was dating. Last year Bezos security chief said the Saudi government was the source of the messages. A month before, Bezos had accused the Enquirers owner of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing intimate photos he allegedly sent to Sanchez. All this took place as Trump - who has closely allied the United States with bin Salman - was clashing with Bezos and the Washington Post in public. \"So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor,\" Trump gloated here on Twitter as news of the clash between Bezos and the Enquirer went public. Trump also took the opportunity to take a shot at the Post: \"Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!\" The Saudi government has denied having anything to do with the National Enquirers reporting. The Guardian newspaper first reported the crown princes alleged involvement in the phone hacking targeting Bezos.

So, on one hand, she got rave reviews for her outing in Gully Boy, she also starred in Kalank that didnt draw audiences. And the actor readily admits the disappointment part that came along with the failure.Anyone who goes on a journey that you have a lot of expectations from is going to feel a certain kind of disappointment. Till date, I have not had too many failures; maybe there are two of them. And my learning through both of them has been very different. But the main thing Ive learnt is that youve to keep your head down, work hard and give your best at everything you do. Sometimes, youll go right and at times, youll go wrong as well, she says.Alia, who has had several hits to credit by now, feels failures have only taught her invaluable lessons. As an actor, an entertainer and even as a person, I have understood the balance that is required in my obsession with work, wherein I am very ambitious and passionate about films, acting, the art and everything. But beyond a point, I cant get too attached to the successes or the failures, says the actor, who has a packed line-up in 2020 with several back-to-back biggies.I derive my joy and happiness by being in front of the camera and learning through people I interact with on sets  whether its my director, co-actors or even the technicians.

But does she find a lot of difference in terms of approaching her parts in completely dissimilar films like Raazi and Gully Boy? Shooting for Raazi was a little emotional [experience], also because I shot it at one go, with no break in between. Probably, thats why the character really connected and stayed with me. But vis--vis Gully Boy, the way I looked at the character was really fun and easy. It was like a break from all my intense characters, he says.Whys Alia feeling guilty!Though Gully Boy was intense, I had a lot of fun shooting for it, mainly due to Safinas infectious spirit. I remember feeling happy every day, which is very unusual for me because usually, I am self-critical and dont like talking too much about my work. Now, when people tell me how amazing my performance is in it, I feel guilty as I am like: did I work hard or why do I deserve this kind of appreciation.

       " 'TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on China on Wednesday to share correct information about a new coronavirus and for the World Health Organisation (WHO) not to exclude Taiwan from collaboration on the outbreak for political reasons. Authorities have confirmed more than 400 cases of the virus in China, most of them in the central city of Wuhan where the virus first appeared at the end of 2019. Nine people have died. The virus, which health officials have said can be passed from person to person, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, as well as Taiwan. Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations unless it accepts it is part of China. Tsai, speaking to reporters after Taiwans Tuesday confirmation of its first case of the coronavirus, a woman returning to Taiwan from Wuhan, said China had to live up to its international obligations. Tsai said she hoped for transparency and that China would share with Taiwan correct information about the virus. This is also beneficial for Chinas people. We believe that political considerations should not come before safeguarding people, she said. Taiwan was a part of the international community and faced the same health challenges and risks as everyone, Tsai said. I again call on the WHO not to exclude Taiwan due to political factors. Taiwan is at the forefront of global epidemic prevention. There needs to be room at the WHO for Taiwans participation. Relations between Taipei and Beijing have nosedived since Tsai took office in 2016, with China suspecting her of pushing for the islands formal independence. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name. The WHO office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email to Reuters on Tuesday that Taiwan was being kept informed. Taiwanese authorities, including health experts, are being informed through cross-strait channels as well as channels connected with the International Health Regulations. WHO is informed that there is cross-strait contact on this matter. The deputy head of Chinas National Health Commission, Li Bin, told reporters in Beijing earlier that experts from Taiwan had been invited to visit Wuhan and the island was being provided with information. In Taipei, Chuang Jen-hsiang, deputy head of Taiwans Centres for Disease Control, confirmed health experts from the island had visited China and that they had good communication channels. But Taiwan is unable to attend emergency meetings arranged by the WHO as it is not a member, he said. We have no way to get the information first hand. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said no-one cared more about the wellbeing of people in Taiwan than China, but its participation in international bodies had to happen under the one China principle. Taiwanese medical experts can participate in WHO technical meetings, WHO experts can visit Taiwan for inspections, and Taiwan can promptly receive WHO information on global public health events, Geng said. Taiwan has advised people not to visit Wuhan unless they absolutely have to and has suspended tourist groups from the city from visiting the island. Despite political tension, Taiwan and China have close business ties, with billions invested in China by Taiwanese businesses such as Foxconn (2317.TW), a key supplier to Apple (AAPL.O). Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has asked employees from its Wuhan plant in China who are in Taiwan for the Lunar New Year holidays to stay at home given the coronavirus outbreak in the city. Since the outbreak, Foxconn workers in Wuhan have been wearing facemasks and getting their temperature checked, the worlds largest contract electronics manufacturer said. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn, advised employees not to visit China over the holiday. The speed of contagion will be no less than SARS, he said at a party for the Lunar New Year in Taipei, referring to a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002-2003. I advise everyone not to go to the mainland for this coming new year holiday, he said. Management has to decide whether employees need to return to Wuhan to work after new year, Gou said, adding Foxconn would come up with solutions for employees to work remotely.  Lunar New Year is the biggest holiday in the Chinese-speaking world, when millions of people travel for family reunions in what is the worlds largest annual human migration.

       " \"The Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, sources have told the Guardian.The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the worlds richest man, according to the results of a digital forensic analysis.This analysis found it highly probable that the intrusion into the phone was triggered by an infected video file sent from the account of the Saudi heir to Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post.The two men had been having a seemingly friendly WhatsApp exchange when, on 1 May of that year, the unsolicited file was sent, according to sources who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity.Large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezoss phone within hours, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Guardian has no knowledge of what was taken from the phone or how it was used.The extraordinary revelation that the future king of Saudi Arabia may have had a personal involvement in the targeting of the American founder of Amazon will send shockwaves from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.It could also undermine efforts by MBS  as the crown prince is known  to lure more western investors to Saudi Arabia, where he has vowed to economically transform the kingdom even as he has overseen a crackdown on his critics and rivals.The disclosure is likely to raise difficult questions for the kingdom about the circumstances around how US tabloid the National Enquirer came to publish intimate details about Bezoss private life  including text messages  nine months later.It may also lead to renewed scrutiny about what the crown prince and his inner circle were doing in the months prior to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was killed in October 2018  five months after the alleged hack of the newspapers owner.Saudi Arabia has previously denied it targeted Bezoss phone, and has insisted the murder of Khashoggi was the result of a rogue operation. In December, a Saudi court convicted eight people of involvement in the murder after a secret trial that was criticised as a sham by human rights experts.Digital forensic experts started examining Bezoss phone following the publication last January by the National Enquirer of intimate details about his private life.Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS, becomes crown prince of Saudi Arabia, designated heir to the king.Donald Trump hosts a private White House dinner for a western adviser to MBS andDavid Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), whichpublishes the National Enquirer.Mohammed bin Salman meets with David Pecker and the western adviser to the crown prince, in Saudi Arabia.Mohammed bin Salmanreportedly tells a top aidehe wants to use a 'bullet' on Jamal Khashoggi, who is writing critical columns in the Washington Post.Mohammed bin Salman arrives in the US for a tour to boost Saudi Arabia's reputation with America's most senior VIPs, business leaders and government officials.Trump hosts Mohammed bin Salman at a meeting in the White House, where the US president calls them 'good friends'.AMI publishes nearly-100-page glossy magazine praising Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin Salman.Mohammed bin Salman is guest of honour at Hollywood dinner.

It is now believed, according to sources, a text message sent from the crown prince to Bezos containeda malicious file that infiltrated the phone.Jeff Bezos sends intimate and private text messages to his girlfriend.Jamal Khashoggi killed in Saudi consulate in Turkey.The National Enquirer publishes expos of Bezos's extramarital affair,including intimate text messages.Jeff Bezos publishes blogpostaccusing the National Enquirerof extortion.Saudi Arabia denies any involvement in the publication of the Bezos story. AMI also later dismiss claims of Saudi involvement, insisting it was tipped offabout the affair by the estranged brother of Bezoss girlfriend.Bezos's security chief, Gavin de Becker, publishes Daily Beast article sayinginvestigators concluded with high confidence Saudis had access to Bezos's phone.UN special rapporteur Agnes Callamard finds credible evidenceSaudi Arabia is responsible for premeditated murder of Jamal Khashoggi.Guardian reveals Bezos's phone was apparently 'hacked' in May 2018 after receiving a personal WhatsApp messagesent fromMohammed bin Salman's personal account.Large amounts of data are exfiltrated from the phone within hours, according to sources.The Guardian has no knowledge about the precise nature of the material that was allegedly taken or what was done with it.The story, which included his involvement in an extramarital relationship, set off a race by his security team to uncover how the CEOs private texts were obtained by the supermarket tabloid, which was owned by American Media Inc (AMI).While AMI insisted it was tipped off about the affair by the estranged brother of Bezoss girlfriend, the investigation by the billionaires own team found with high confidence that the Saudis had managed to access Bezoss phone and had gained private information about him.Bezoss head of security, Gavin de Becker, wrote in the Daily Beast last March he had provided details of his investigation to law enforcement officials, but did not publicly reveal any information on how the Saudis accessed the phone.He also described the close relationship the Saudi crown prince had developed with David Pecker, the chief executive of the company that owned the Enquirer, in the months before the Bezos story was published. De Becker did not respond to calls and messages from the Guardian. The Guardian understands a forensic analysis of Bezoss phone, and the indications that the hack began within an infected file from the crown princes account, has been reviewed by Agns Callamard, the UN special rapporteur who investigates extrajudicial killings. It is understood that it is considered credible enough for investigators to be considering a formal approach to Saudi Arabia to ask for an explanation. Callamard, whose own investigation into the murder of Khashoggi found credible evidence the crown prince and other senior Saudi officials were responsible for the killing, confirmed to the Guardian she was still pursuing several leads into the murder, but declined to comment on the alleged Bezos link.When asked by the Guardian whether she would challenge Saudi Arabia about the new hacking allegation, Callamard said she followed all UN protocols that require investigators to alert governments about forthcoming public allegations.Saudi experts  dissidents and analysts  told the Guardian they believed Bezos was probably targeted because of his ownership of the Post and its coverage of Saudi Arabia. Khashoggis critical columns about Mohammed bin Salman and his campaign of repression against activists and intellectuals rankled the crown prince and his inner circle.Andrew Miller, a Middle East expert who served on the national security council under President Obama, said if Bezos had been targeted by the crown prince, it reflected the personality-based environment in which the crown prince operates.He probably believed that if he got something on Bezos it could shape coverage of Saudi Arabia in the Post. It is clear that the Saudis have no real boundaries or limits in terms of what they are prepared to do in order to protect and advance MBS, whether it is going after the head of one of the largest companies in the world or a dissident who is on their own.The possibility that the head of one of Americas leading companies was targeted by Saudi Arabia could pose a dilemma for the White House.Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner have maintained close ties with the crown prince despite a US intelligence finding  reportedly with a mediumtohigh degree of certainty  that Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggis  murder.Both Saudi Arabia and AMI have denied that the kingdom was involved in the publication of the Bezos story.A lawyer for Bezos who was contacted by the Guardian said: I have no comment on this except to say that Mr Bezos is cooperating with investigations.The Guardian asked the Saudi embassy in Washington about the claims. It did not immediately return a request for comment but later said on Twitter that suggestions Saudi Arabia was responsible for the hack were absurd.Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr. Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd. We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out.Have you got new information about this story?

I am glad you did cause strongest people most often forget to share their pain... thank you Chotu Kangana had told Mumbai Mirror that she did tacky films when she was 19 just to help Rangoli. I was just 19, on the threshold of a bright career, when the attack happened and it was a long, hard struggle to deal with this kind of perverse, sexist cruelty. Financially too, I was not strong back then. Girls around me would feel depressed by a bad hair day or because a meal was not to their liking. I was grappling with something far more real and yet had no time to sit and cry. I did tacky films, took on roles I did not deserve, accepted guest appearances, so my sister could be treated by the best surgeon in India. It took 54 surgeries.Recently, Rangoli tweeted about her attack and even revealed the attackers identity. In three separate tweets, Rangoli wrote: My attackers name is Avinash Sharma, he was in the same college as me, we were in the same friend circle, he proposed to me I started keeping distance I didnt share same feelings, he would tell people some day he will marry me. When my parents got me engaged to an Air Force officer he became very persistent about marrying me when I retaliated he threatened me to throw acid on me, I brushed such threats aside and never told my parents or went to cops this was the biggest mistake of my life.Also read: Bigg Boss 13: Sidharth Shukla says he is done with Asim Riaz and wants to quit, fight divides TwitterI was sharing PG house with four girls, a young stranger came asking for me my friend vijaya said someone asking for you I opened the door, he was carrying a jug full of  (acid)...and just then in one second CHAPPAK, she wrote.

       " 'Actor Kangana Ranaut has weighed in on the controversy surrounding actor Saif Ali Khans recent comments about Indias history and identity. Kangana said people are following smaller narratives that they have created to suit themselves. In an interview with film critic Anupama Chopra, Saif had talked about the current social climate in the country and the polarising politics of his latest film Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior. I dont think this is history, Saif said I dont think there was a concept of India till the British gave it one.Kangana was asked to comment on the same by Zee News when she said the existence of Mahabharata proves that a united India existed before the British took over the country. This is not true. If there was no Bharat then what was Mahabharat? That 5,000-year-old text that was written, what was it? What did Ved Vyas write? Some people have just created these narratives that suit them. Sri Krishna was in Mahabharat. So there was a Bharat, thats why it was mahaan (great). All the kings of India came together to fight that war. So its natural..., she said.ALSO WATCH |Saif Ali Khan promotes upcoming film Jawaani Jaaneman in JuhuYou see even Europe has these small nations. But these had a collective identity, thats why Sri Krishna went to all these places with Pandavas and the Kauravas, to ask them who will be a part of the war, she added. Kanganas sister Rangoli Chandel shared the video on Twitter and wrote, Kangana asking Saif Ali Khan a very important question ... over to you Saif.Saif had said that he could not refuse the delicious role offered to him in Tanhaji but may take a stand next time. For some reason I didnt take a stand. Maybe next time I would. I was very excited to play the role because its a delicious role. But when people say this is history, I dont think this is history. I am quite aware of what the history was. I dont think there was a concept of India till perhaps the British gave it one. I dont think there is really any constructive point in arguing about loudly, provided you yourself know why youre doing it, Saif had said. He is now being criticised by some for his remarks while many are also supporting him. Some even trolled him for naming his son Taimur. I am sure History buff Saif Ali Khan never heard or read about Taimur/Timur , a Turko-Mongol conquerer who devastated much of Asia in the period around 1400 .. otherwise he wud have never named his cute son Taimur Ali Khan .. just saying, wrote a Twitter user.Also read: Bigg Boss 13: Sidharth Shukla says he is done with Asim Riaz and wants to quit, fight divides TwitterKanganas Panga co-star Richa Chadha, who was sitting next to her in the same interview, defended the actors son on Twitter.

The degree took me 3 years at St Stephens... ummm so am saving you the embarrassment because this IQ thing would definitely be a grossly unfair contest.Previously, Kangana and Saif got involved in a controversy when Saif made fun of her on IIFA stage for her comments against nepotism in 2017.

       " 'British writer George Orwell wrote to a female friend to say that they could have sex twice a year with his wifes approval, a set of letters bought by Orwells son show, nearly 70 years after his death.Orwell met Brenda Salkeld a few years before his first publishing success, Down and Out in Paris and London in 1933 and she became an influence on his writing, according to the letters which were reported in The Times newspaper on Monday.Orwell told Salkeld that his first wife, Eileen OShaughnessy, understood his desires and she wished I could sleep with you about twice a year, just to keep me happy.In an earlier letter, he wrote: I dont know if you have ever realised quite how much you mean to me. Besides you said you thought you would finally take a lover, and if so I dont see why it shouldnt be me.He continued to write to her until 1949 - just before his second wedding and only weeks before his death. The letters showed he used Salkeld as a sounding board for his ideas.Orwells son, Richard Blair, said he bought the letters to give to the George Orwell Archive at University College London.Another set of letters bought by Blair also showed Orwells continued admiration for a former lover, Eleanor Jacques. Blair told The Times that the letters showed Jacques and Salkeld had far more influence on him than first supposed.They were very personal letters, he said. I think there was a bit of physical contact in both cases from time to time. He liked very strong women. Women who had an opinion. That is what attracted him. The fact he got anything after that was a bonus.Orwell, who also wrote the novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, remains widely known for his criticism of governments and totalitarianism. The 70th anniversary of Orwells death is on January 21. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter',\n",
       " ' A 29-year-old man was stabbed to death outside a dance bar in Ulhasnagar, in the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. Deepak Bhoir was a resident of Manere village and is survived by his parents and two elder sisters. His uncle is Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation corporator Vimal Bhoir. Closed circuit television (CCTV) camera footage showed Bhoir was murdered by Naresh Chavhan, 32, who is yet to be arrested. Ulhasnagar Police said the investigation is underway and four people have been detained for questioning.At 1.30am on Tuesday, Bhoir and a friend went to a dance bar in Ulhasnagar. Initial investigation has revealed Bhoir had gone to meet someone at the bar. A woman called Bhoir up and asked him to meet her at the bar. This may have been a trap, said a police officer from Ulhasnagar police station on condition of anonymity.Thirty minutes later, Bhoir and his friend left the dance bar. Just outside, the two men found themselves surrounded by Chavhan and five accomplices. Chavhan was known to Bhoir. According to sources, Bhoir and Chavhans brother had got into a fight a few months ago, allegedly over a woman. Chavhan and his accomplices were armed with a gun and knives. Bhoir and his friend tried to run away, but the six attackers were able to catch Bhoir and stab him 30 times.CCTV camera footage shows the murder took place at 2.05am on Tuesday. Bhoirs friend started running and he [Bhoir] was behind him. But the accused caught hold of Deepak and stabbed him repeatedly. They stabbed him 30 times on his chest, stomach and back, said deputy commissioner of police, Pramod Shewale. The footage showed Chavhan and his accomplices leaving Bhoir for dead after stabbing him. Bhoirs friend informed his family, who then alerted the police. Ulhasnagar Police reached the scene of the crime and took Bhoir to Ulhasnagar Central Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.Shewale said, We have gathered information that the accused wanted to take revenge for some old fight. We will get clarity about the motive after the accused is arrested.This is the second time that this particular dance bar has been the scene of a violent crime. In 2012, property dealer Rajesh Kukreja was murdered inside the same bar by former Shiv Sena corporator Shekhar Yadav and Sunil Chikne, who was part of Maharashtra Navnirman Senas transport committee.

The victim Maitulla Ari was accosted by four youth on a motorcycle, who ironically, had initially helped one of them up after he had fallen off his bike. But things took an ugly turn when they questioned Ari how he got hold of a Goa registered motorcycle which ended in a confrontation and a stabbing. Ari, 24, is being treated at a local hospital and his condition is stated to be serious. Sanmesh Shet, the president of the Goa University Students Union, has denounced the attack. We have gathered here in order to ensure that he gets justice and to protest the attack. These students are here as part of an exchange programme and for as long as they are here, they are like one of us. Attacks like these will instill fear among students and soon no one will feel safe in the university campus and no one will want to come here. It will be a shame for us, Sanmesh Shet, the president of the Goa University Students Council, said.The National Students Union of India too has condemned the attack and called for increased protection at the university.The work of the government is to protect the state and the students that come to study, but there is absolute fear in the minds of the student body. The attack on the Afghani student in Goa also brings a question mark to the security of the foreign students who come to study and will send a very wrong message to the entire world regarding the law and order of the country, NSUI state president Akbar Mulla said in a statement.There are around 35 students who are studying at the Goa University as part of an Indian Centre for Cultural Relations (ICCR) programme to allow students to study at Universities across India.

       " 'OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Thirty-six civilians were killed in Burkina Faso on Monday in what the government called a terrorist attack on a market in Sanmatenga province. Armed militants forced their way into the market of the village of Alamou and attacked people there before burning the structure to the ground, the government said in a statement on Tuesday. The bloodshed is part of a surge in violence in the West African country that has killed hundreds, forced nearly a million from their homes and made much of the north ungovernable over the past two years. These repeated attacks on innocent civilians call for real cooperation between defense and security forces, the government said. President Roch Marc Kabore called for two days of national mourning in response to the attack. It was not immediately clear who was responsible. Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have carried out increasingly brazen attacks against civilian and military targets in Burkina Faso in recent months, including an attack on a mining convoy in November that killed nearly 40 people.  The country was once a pocket of relative calm in the Sahel region, but its homegrown insurgency has been amplified by a spillover of jihadist violence and criminality from its chaotic northern neighbor Mali.

The Titanic was deemed an \"unsinkable ship\" and was the largest passenger ship afloat in 1912.The ocean liner sank after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic.Of the 2,223 passengers and crew on board, only 706 survived, according to the US Senate report on the disaster, CNN reported.Signed by the UK in 2003, the treaty comes into force after being ratified by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the end of 2019.The wreck has not previously been protected under explicit legislation as it lies in international waters.British Maritime Minister Nusrat Ghani described the agreement as \"momentous\".\"Lying two and a half miles below the ocean surface, the RMS Titanic is the subject of the most documented maritime tragedy in history,\" she was quoted as saying by the BBC in Belfast.\"It will be treated with the sensitivity and respect owed to the final resting place of more than 1,500 lives.\"Ghani added that the UK will now work closely with other North Atlantic countries, like Canada and France, to bring \"even more protection\" to Titanic.The wreck was discovered in 1985 about 350 nautical miles off the Canadian coast of Newfoundland, two-and-a-half miles below the ocean surface.Divers visited the wreckage in August for the first time in 14 years.

       " 'TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has written to Pope Francis to complain about Chinese pressure on the island Beijing claims as its own, saying China seeks to threaten its democracy and freedom. The Vatican is one of just 15 countries that has diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the only one in Europe. But Taiwan has been concerned by the Vaticans moves to normalize ties with China, especially after a landmark 2018 pact on appointing bishops. China, which believes Tsai wants formal independence for Taiwan, has heaped pressure on the president, who won re-election by a landslide this month on a platform of standing up to Beijing. Tsai says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. Taiwan hopes for a peaceful resolution of its differences with China, Tsai wrote in her letter, released by the presidential office on Tuesday, in response to a message from  Pope Francis for the World Day of Peace on Jan. 1. However, at present dialogue across the Taiwan Strait is filled with difficulties, she wrote. The main sticking point is that China has so far been unwilling to let go of its desire to control Taiwan. She added, It continues to threaten Taiwans democratic freedoms and human rights by threatening to use force against Taiwan, fake news, cyber attacks, and diplomatic means. But despite Chinas severe suppression, Taiwan is moving forward, cooperating with friendly and similar-minded countries, so that other democracies recognize it as the best partner for maintaining peace and stability, she added. Chinas recent military operations and exercises in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding areas have caused regional unrest and increased international distrust of it, Tsai said.  China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan since Tsai first won office in 2016, flying bomber patrols around the island and sending its latest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, through the sensitive Taiwan Strait in the election run-up.     Beijing cut diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1951 and remains concerned an independent church in China could threaten its authority. The 2018 deal, in the making for more than 10 years, gives the Vatican a long-sought say in the choice of bishops in China, previously solely appointed by Communist authorities. Critics, particularly conservative Catholics, have labeled it a sellout. Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez',\n",

       " 'Respected American singer-songwriter David Olney said sorry to fans before he died during a performance in Florida. The 71-year-old was mid-song when he stopped, apologised and shut his eyes, said musician Amy Rigby, who was performing alongside him at the 30A Songwriters festival in Santa Rosa Beach.Rigby said: He was very still, sitting upright with his guitar on, wearing the coolest hat and a beautiful rust suede jacket  I want the picture to be as graceful and dignified as it was, because it at first looked as if he was just taking a moment.Olneys fellow musicians, doctors present in the audience, and paramedics unsuccessfully attempted to revive the singer. His publicist believes he died of an apparent heart attack.NPR critic Ann Powers described Olneys death as a major loss to the Nashville songwriter community.Olney was born in Rhode Island in 1948. He moved to Nashville in 1973 and formed a band called the X-Rays, who recorded two albums in the 1980s. As a solo artist, he released more than 20 albums.

       " 'Six of Indias 10 most polluted cities are in Uttar Pradesh, according to Greenpeace Indias fourth Airpocalypse report released on Tuesday.Noida, Ghaziabad, Bareilly, Allahabad, Moradabad and Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh figure in list of 10 most polluted cities topped by Jharia in Jharkhand and closely followed by Dhanbad in the same state.According to the report based on analysis of particulate matter (PM) data of 287 cities, Delhi was 10th most polluted city in 2018, an improvement by two notches as compared to 2017. Greenpeace has used Central Pollution Control Board data to rank the most polluted cities in India. Lunglei in Mizoram is the least polluted followed by Meghalayas Dawki. Lunglei is also the only Indian city with PM levels under the World Health Organisations (WHO) prescribed level of 20/ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter), the report said. Jharia and Dhanbad are twin cities in the coal mining belt of Jharkhand. PM-10 level was recorded at 322 ug/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) in Jharia, which was the highest in the country. In Dhanbad, PM-10 level was recorded at 264 un/m3 in Dhanbad, which is the second highest in the country.Jharkhand pollution board officials said vehicular emission, road dust, air pollution from bio-mass burning, air pollution from industry, construction and demolition activities, diesel generator sets and use of coal in dhabas and road side eateries were major drivers for worsening the air quality in Dhanbad and Jharia.The data of 2018 was analysed in the report and we are in 2020. The measures taken to improve the condition in past one year did not reflect in it. Improvement in the air quality will be visible in the next years report, as several steps have been taken, said AK Rastogi, chairman of Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB).He said several restrictions were imposed on unscientific coal dumping and coal transportation. We are also trying to find out source of pollution. National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, is studying the source of pollution in Jharia and it will submit its report very soon, Rastogi said, adding, they have also planned to install air quality measurement devices at 101 places of the state including two places in Dhanbad.In 2019, the central government launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), a five-year action plan with a target of reducing concentrations of PM-10 and PM-2.5 up to 30% by 2024 in 102 non-attainment cities, with 2017 as the base year. The Greenpeace report said the air pollution data shows that Indian cities were not progressing well to achieve the NCAP target.The permissible limit for PM-10 is 60 ug/m3, according to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), while it is mere 20 ug/m3, as per the World Health Organization (WHO), said Avinash Chanchal, senior campaigner of Greenpeace India. WHO says PM-10 starts impacting health after it exceeds 20 ug/m3 limit.',\n",

       " \"(Reuters) - Attorneys for a former Apple Inc executive on Tuesday will try to convince a skeptical judge of a core tenet of tech startup culture - that employees can plan a competing venture while still in a job. Apples lawsuit against a former chip executive-turned-rival will have implications for employees all over California who are considering striking out on their own and creating the startups that drive tech business and culture. Californias long-held public policy favors employee mobility in contrast to states that allow strong non-compete agreements. That stance allowed for the traitorous eight who left their jobs at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory for a rival in the late 1950s and who eventually spawned dozens of companies, including Intel Corp. Apple filed the lawsuit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against Gerard Williams III, who left the company last year after more than nine years as chief architect for the custom processors that power iPhones and iPads to start Nuvia Inc, which is designing chips for servers.  Judge Mark H. Pierce last week issued a tentative ruling allowing the case to proceed but barring Apple from seeking punitive damages. Pierce will decide after a hearing on Tuesday whether to make his ruling final.  Apple sued Williams in August, alleging that he breached an intellectual property agreement and a duty of loyalty to the company by planning his new startup while on company time at Apple, spending hours on the phone with colleagues who eventually joined the venture. Apple declined to comment on the case. Through a spokesman, Williams declined to comment. Apple is not suing Nuvia itself or any of Williams co-founders and it did not allege any intellectual property or trade secret theft. According to a copy of Williams agreement that Apple attached to its complaint, the contract required that Williams will not plan or engage in any other employment that competes with Apple or is directly related to the company. In a filing in November, Williams argued that Apples contract was unenforceable because California law allows employees to make some preparations to compete while still in their current job. Even in California, there are limits, said Cliff Palefsky, a prominent San Francisco-based employment attorney. Workers can lay some plans for a competitor on their own time, but recruiting fellow employees on company time gets a little dicey. In his tentative ruling, Pierce wrote that an employee is not permitted to plan and prepare to create a competitive enterprise prior to termination if the employee does so on their employers time and with the employers resources. The case will likely hinge the specific facts of Williams planning for Nuvia, Palefsky said. Given that work at modern tech jobs rarely sticks to traditional business hours, it may be difficult to untangle whether calls were made during company time or personal time. That phrase - that you cant plan to compete - raises a very interesting question of whether (Apples contract) is violative of the public policy and whether the courts are going to enforce it, he said. This is going to be some groundbreaking stuff, one way or the other. The court has not set a trial date.

The House was adjourned thrice as pandemonium prevailed over the rule position and ministers trooped into the Well asking the Chairman of the Upper House to take up the Bill on priority.The TDP, which is in a majority in the 58-member Council, gave a notice under Rule 71 and moved a motion \"disapproving the policy of the government.\" Chairman M A Sharrif allowed the TDP\\'s motion much to the chagrin of the ruling YSR Congress, which barely has nine members in the Council.Though almost all Cabinet ministers sat in the Council to thwart the TDP attempts to stall the Bill, which was passed by the Assembly late on Monday night, they could not convince the Chairman to let the Bill be moved.\"I am giving two hours time for a discussion under Rule 71. We can take up the Bill after that,\" the Chairman said but the ministers insisted that government business be taken up first. At one time the ministers spoke in a pleading tone and requested that the Chairman reconsider his decision on the Rule 71 motion.Senior minister Botsa Satyanarayana asked the Chairman not to use the Council for \"political business.\" \"Don\\'t use your discretionary powers for political gains.

       " 'The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has asked operators to run a media campaign to make mobile phone subscribers aware about the procedure to register their consent and preferences in case of spam messages and calls and a facility to make complaints if such calls persist.The sector regulator issued this direction to phone operators late on Monday.Trai has asked operators to run a media campaign to make the customers aware regarding procedure and facilities for: registration of preference, registration and revocation of consents, making complaints or reporting of unsolicited commercial communications, and that they shall not get involved in the activity of sending commercial communication\", it said in the direction to telcos.In July last year, the regulator had asked operators to adopt blockchain or distributed ledger technology to ensure only registered telemarketers have access to phone databases and that user consent to receive such communication is explicitly recorded.Under the Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulations, telecom service providers were asked to use the distributed ledger technology (DLT) to control the flow of commercial communication on their networks.Since blockchain secures information cryptographically through the use of keys and signatures to control who can do what within the shared ledger, only registered telemarketers will be able to discharge certain functions.Under the rules issued last year, companies that want to communicate with interested users have to confirm their identity through a header registered in their name and access providers must now provide facility to digitally record and revoke consent of the subscribers.No significant progress has been shown by access providers for migration of existing headers and consents with principal entities to DLT system of access providers,\" Trai said on Monday.Out of approximately 9 lakh unique headers existing in market, as per the information submitted by access providers, so far negligible number of headers have been registered by principal entities...many principal entities across all access providers are not fully aware about the requirements and steps of registration of entity, header, consent etc,\" Trai said.The regulator has also directed operators to ensure that users consent shall be registered in the new system and entities are not able to send any commercial communication till they register themselves with mobile service providers.This was prompted by the fact that spam calls persisted despite restrictions on telemarketers as people arent aware of the implications of sharing numbers and the absence of a robust mechanism to record consent.',\n",

In 2019, we faced headwinds on account of Jet Airways but 2020 is going to be different and the double-digit growth should be back sooner rather than later,\" a DGCA official said on condition of anonymity.InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which operates IndiGo, strengthened its leadership, carrying nearly one in every two passengers. Its market share stood at 47.1% during 2019, up from 41.5% in 2018. The airline carried 67.91 million passengers in 2019, up from nearly 57.62 million in 2018.Low-fare airline SpiceJet Ltd flew 21.53 million passengers, achieving 14.9% market share in 2019. The Ajay Singh-led airline had carried 17.1 million passengers in 2018, with a market share of 12.3%.State-run Air India Ltd clocked a 12.7% domestic market share, flying 18.36 million passengers in 2019. The airline had a similar market share during the previous year.It started as a market correction, (and) overcapacity was resulting in destructive pricing.

       " 'US President Donald Trump on Monday rejected the Democratic-led House of Representatives impeachment charges and called for their immediate dismissal by the Republican-led Senate in a memo offering a legal and political case against his removal.The 116-page Trial Memorandum sought to undercut charges that the Republican president abused his power and obstructed Congress, and constituted Trumps first comprehensive defense before his Senate trial begins in earnest on Tuesday.The Senate should reject the Articles of Impeachment and acquit the president immediately, the memo concluded.Separately, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell put forward rules that could lead to a quick impeachment trial for Trump, with no guarantee that witnesses or new evidence would be allowed.Under the resolution, which could face a vote as early as Tuesday, lawyers for Trump could move early in the proceedings to ask senators to dismiss all charges, a senior Republican leadership aide said, a motion that would likely fail.Under the Republican proposal, the Senate would have to vote later on whether to even allow materials collected by the House during its impeachment investigation to be admitted as part of the trial.Trump, only the fourth of 45 American presidents to face the possibility of being ousted by impeachment, is charged with abusing the powers of his office by asking Ukraine to investigate a Democratic political rival, Joe Biden, and obstructing a congressional inquiry into his conduct.Democrats say Trump abused his power by withholding US military assistance to Ukraine as part of a pressure campaign and obstructed Congress by refusing to hand over documents and barring administration officials from testifying, even when subpoenaed by House investigators.Trumps defense argued neither charge constituted a crime or impeachable offense, that he was within his rights as president to make decisions about foreign policy and what information to give Congress, and that the House pursued a flawed and one-sided process before impeaching him on December 18.The memos executive summary asserted that the House Democrats novel theory of abuse of power was not an impeachable offense and supplanted the US Constitutions standard of Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.It rejected the obstruction of Congress charge as frivolous and dangerous, saying the president exercised his legal rights by resisting congressional demands for information, also known as subpoenas.It also accused the House Democrats of conducting a rigged process, said they succeeded in proving only that Trump had done nothing wrong and argued, as the White House has repeatedly, that this was an effort to overturn Trumps 2016 election victory and to prevent his re-election in November.While the Senate is highly unlikely to remove Trump from office, it is important for him to try to diminish the Democratic accusations to limit political damage to his bid for a second term.Chilling assertionIn part of his legal filing, Trumps lawyers cast their arguments in unabashedly political terms.They want to use impeachment to interfere in the 2020 election, the memo said. Put simply, Democrats have no response to the Presidents record of achievement in restoring prosperity to the American economy, rebuilding Americas military, and confronting Americas adversaries abroad.In their own filing with the Senate on Monday, the seven House impeachment managers who will make the Democrats case for Trumps removal to the Senate said he had jeopardized our national security and our democratic self-governance.President Trump maintains that the Senate cannot remove him even if the House proves every claim in the Articles of impeachment. That is a chilling assertion. It is also dead wrong, they wrote, arguing that despite Trumps stonewalling, the House had amassed overwhelming evidence of his guilt.Trumps team says he was well within his constitutional authority to press Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last year to investigate Biden and his son Hunter as part of what Trump says was an anti-corruption drive. The Bidens deny any wrongdoing and Trumps allegations have been widely debunked.While Trumps legal papers laid out extensive arguments as to why he did not commit a crime, the General Accounting Office, the watchdog arm of Congress, said last week that Trump did commit a crime by withholding US military assistance to Ukraine, money that was ultimately sent after a brief pause.Seeking to show he is still conducting presidential business despite the trial, Trump left late on Monday for Davos, Switzerland, to join global leaders at the World Economic Forum. Some advisers argued against his making the trip, where he will meet Iraqi, Pakistani, Swiss, Kurdish and European Union leaders.As a result, he will be in the Alps when the Senate on Tuesday engages in a potentially bruising battle over whether witnesses should be allowed to testify in the trial and whether new documents could be introduced, as Democrats wish.The resolution McConnell unveiled on Monday would give House Democratic prosecutors and Trump lawyers 48 hours, evenly split, to present their arguments over a maximum of four days.It drew immediate criticism from Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who accused McConnell of failing to stick to the rules used during President Bill Clintons 1998 impeachment, calling it nothing short of a national disgrace.Its clear Senator McConnell is hell-bent on making it much more difficult to get witnesses and documents and intent on rushing the trial through, Schumer said in a statement.While there could be a fast-track trial, Democrats could slow things down by proposing that a series of witnesses testify.

Faces of political leaders are morphed on Chhatrapati Shivaji and Tanhaji and are being circulated for an election campaign. Shivaji Maharaj is our idol and we will not tolerate his insult, he said.Tanhaji had fought the historic battle for Sinhagad Fort in Pune under Shivaji on February 4, 1670, which was under the control of a Rajput commander, Udaybhan Singh Rathore, guided by Maharaja Jai Singh I, an ally of the Mughals.In a veiled jibe at the BJP lawmaker and Shivajis descendant, Udayanraje Bhosale, Raut said he has forwarded the news articles and videos to the ones who called for a shutdown in Sangli and Satara. He said that he is waiting for their reaction.Book comparisonThe book Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi written by Jai Bhagwan Goyal, a former Sena worker, was released in the BJPs headquarters in New Delhi earlier this month. It had stirred a political controversy as the Shiv Sena slammed the BJP over the book and the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party also questioned the comparison.Sanjay Raut had in a series of tweets questioned the book and the BJP and then attempted to corner the leaders of the opposition party in Maharashtra and asked if the comparison is acceptable to them.The Sena leader had asked Udayanraje Bhosale and Shivendraraje Bhosale, the descendants of Shivaji, who are in the BJP, to resign over the issue. The Rajya Sabha MP had also asked Udayanraje Bhosale to prove he is a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji.The book was withdrawn after the uproar.',\n",
       " 'With back-door meetings to persuade protesters yet to bring any results, Delhi Police are now using Twitter to request the protesters to clear the road, a 2.5km-long connection between Delhi and Noida, at Shaheen Bagh.Thousands of people, including women and children, are protesting for more than a month now at Shaheen Bagh and nearby Jamia Millia Islamia to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The protesters have set up a stage on the carriageway towards Noida from Sarita Vihar on the road, which has prompted the police to close all traffic towards Noida and Delhi. Protesters have also blocked the opposite carriageway going to Delhi from Noida with a 30 feet high India map made of iron. The closure has led to spillover jams in Ashram and parts of Mathura Road, with other Noida-Delhi connections farther away, such as the Nizamuddin bridge, also being hit.Extreme hardshipDelhi Police are now urging the protesters on Twitter. We have already appealed to you once before. Meanwhile, more complaints have been received regarding inconvenience due to blockade of Road No.13A, particularly to school children who are facing extreme hardship in reaching their schools, coaching centres and private tuitions, Delhi Police tweeted on Monday. Their parents have expressed deep anxiety in view of forthcoming Board examinations. Daily commuters, local residents and businesspersons are also facing acute harassment, they said.The police then issued an appeal to the protesters to clear the road so that normal traffic could be restored.The number of protesters goes up to at least a thousand at any time of the day. Two kitchens that offer free food and tea to the protesters have also opened on the side of Road 13A. In response to polices appeal, a few Twitter users claiming to be Shaheen Bagh protestersHT could not independently verify their identityreplied they too were facing hardships because of the new citizenship law. Another user replied with a video of a group of people opening a barricade and allowing a school van to pass through it. But the police said such videos are only half-truths. They may have opened barricade and cleared the road at a spot which is more than a kilometre away from the sit-in protest. Both the carriageway is blocked. No school bus or cab from Noida of parts of Delhi can use the road. This is a lie spread on social media, a police officer, who did not wish to be named, said. In another tweet two days ago the Delhi Police had said, We appeal to agitators at Road No. 13 A Shaheen Bagh to understand the sufferings that the complete highway blockade is causing to residents of Delhi & NCR, Senior Citizens, emergency patients & school going children.Many Twitter users had replied to that tweet as well.One of them wrote, these people can go through the other way home, office, hospital, but what about the mental torture we are facing...PILs in courtThe matter is in court as well.After filing a public interest litigation (PIL) at Delhi High Court, lawyer-activist Amit Sahni has approached the Supreme Court. Sahni has sought its directions to the police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch.Sahni has filed the special leave petition in the top court also seeking supervision of the situation in Shaheen Bagh by a retired Supreme Court judge or a sitting judge of Delhi High Court in order to circumvent any violence.Delhi High Court on January 14 did not order forthwith removal of traffic restrictions, he said in his plea, adding the HC had said that no direction can be issued by it on how to handle an agitation or the place of protest and the traffic as it depended on ground reality and wisdom of police. The high court had reiterated its order to the police on January 17 directing the force to look into the traffic situation in Shaheen Bagh.Traffic police estimates show the Ashram intersection, the worst hit by the closure of Road 13A, used to get nearly 350,000 vehicles during peak morning and evening rush hours. However, over the last month, it has been taking an additional load of 100,000 vehicles a day.The protests at Shaheen Bagh have continued even after a section of organisers pulled out on January 2.',\n",
       " 'The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will not be taken back, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday as he called for a public debate on the legislation that has triggered country-wide protests and forced the BJP to launch an awareness campaign.Addressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh Lucknow, the Union home minister also lashed out at the Congress saying its actions divided the country. On his line of attack were Congress Rahul Gandhi as well as West Bengal chief Mamata Banerjee and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav.The anti-CAA parties are spreading propaganda and spreading illusions thats why the BJP is running the Jan Jagran Abhiyan, which is a public awareness campaign against those who break the country, Amit Shah said.Watch l Wont withdraw CAA; challenge opposition leaders for a debate: Amit ShahLet it be very loud and clear to our opponents that the citizenship law wont be rolled back at any cost, irrespective of the protests, Shah said of the amended law which will enable the government to give citizenship to non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.The minister reiterated that there is no provision for taking the citizenship of anyone anywhere under CAA and said that people will rather get Indias citizenship.I have introduced this bill in the Lok Sabha. I want to tell the opposition that you should discuss this bill publicly. If it can take citizenship of any person, then prove it and show it, he said.As several people from the minority communities in the three Muslim-majority countries, who had taken refuge in various parts of the politically-crucial state, attended the rally, Shah accused the opposition of indulging in politics over the issue.Aankh ke andhe, kaan ke behre netaon ko in par huey atyachar dikhai nahi padta (The blind and deaf leaders cant see the atrocities heaped on these persecuted minorities), Shah said.The senior minister was severely critical of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav whose daughter was spotted recently at Lucknows Clock Tower in the old city area where Muslim women have been on an indefinite protest against the citizenship law.Akhilesh ji you keep talking through scripted speeches. I dare you to speak independently for five minutes on the citizenship issue, he said.Womens protestHis rally comes even as the protest led by women against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) entered its fifth day.Police have booked 16 women and more than 100 unidentified persons, including two daughters of poet Munawwar Rana, in connection with the anti-CAA protest at Clock Tower in Chowk area of the capital of Uttar Pradesh.Ahead of the rally, the police took out a flag mark at Clock Tower, the point where women are protesting but the efforts to pacify the protestors went in vain. The protest spread to Ujariaon area of Gomti Nagar where over 15 women staged a sit-in near a dargah, holding placards showing anti-CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) slogans.Sins of CongressHe lashed out at the Congress as he used data to point to the decreasing number of minorities in Bangladesh and Pakistan.At the time of partition, Hindu, Sikh Buddhist and Jain constituted 30% of the population in Bangladesh and 23% in Pakistan. But today its just 7% & 3%, respectively. Where have these people gone? Those who are protesting against CAA, I want to ask them this, he said.The sins of the Congress has led to the division of India on the basis of religion. The number of minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh continued to decrease. Where did these people go? Some were killed, some were forcibly converted, the minister said.Amit Shah also reminded the Congress of its promise of citizenship to the people from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan in Rajasthan.In the last assembly election in Rajasthan, the Congress had said in its manifesto that Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan will be given citizenship. If you do it then is all right and when Modi ji does it then you protest, he said.He went on to invoke Mahatma Gandhi and the countrys first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to say emphasise his governments thrust for the legislation.Mahatma Gandhi had said in 1947 that Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan can come to India, Shah said. The Father of the Nation had said that giving them citizenship, giving them pride should be the duty of the Indian government, Shah pointed out. Nehruji had said that the Central Relief Fund should be used to provide relief to the refugees. They should do whatever is necessary to give them citizenship, but Congress did nothing, he said.Shahs address in Lucknow was his first political rally after relinquishing the post of the Bharatiya Janata Partys chief in keeping with one man, one post principle of BJP.It was among the six rallies by top BJP leaders, the party has planned in UP on citizenship law.Newly-elected BJP chief JP Nadda will be in Agra on Thursday to drum up support for the recent amendment in the act.

Political strategist and party vice president Prashant Kishor is another.Varma recalled Nitish Kumars strong views about the BJP and its politics back in 2012 and later. .He wrote: However, the cause for confusion arises from the fact that even after you changed tracks and aligned again with the BJP in 2017, your private apprehensions regarding the BJP did not change.For instance, I remember your confessing to me in private how the current leadership in the BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained, on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a dangerous space. It was your personal view, as conveyed to me, that the BJP is destroying institutions, and that there is a need for democratic and socialiust forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official, Varma said.Varma said if these were his real views, he couldnt understand how the JDU was extending its alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar when even long standing allies of the BJP, like the Akali Dal, have refused to do so.This is especially so at a time when the BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive socially divisive agenda, aimed at mutilating the peace, harmony and stability of the country, the letter, written against the backdrop of protests over the amended citizenship law and citizens register, said.',\n",

From gas utility GAIL, the DoT has sought  1.72 lakh crore.Mishra said his company\\'s contract with the DoT provides for any dispute to be referred to TDSAT and so the company will be approaching the tribunal.Following the Supreme Court\\'s October 24 order that non-telecom revenues earned by firms using spectrum or airwaves allocated by the government should be considered for calculating statutory dues, the DoT has totalled all the revenues earned by a company in last 15 years and raised demand.Sources said companies like OIL pay excise duty, oil development cess, profit petroleum and other levies to the government on oil and gas they produce and do not trade bandwidth to outside parties to earn any revenue.The optic fibre is only for internal communication purposes such as monitoring wells and production control, they said.OIL is not going to the Supreme Court as the company was not part of the litigation before the apex court and no direction was issued to it by the court.From GAIL, the DoT has sought  1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence.In response, GAIL has told the DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government.The firm told DoT that it had obtained ISP licence in 2002 for a period of 15 years, which expired in 2017. But GAIL never did any business under the licence, and since no revenue was generated it cannot pay any amount.On IP-1 and IP-2 licences, GAIL has told the DoT that it generated  35 crore of revenue since 2001-02 and not  2,49,788 crore that has been considered for levying past dues, they said adding the revenue number the DoT is considering is after adding all the revenues that the company earned from gas trading and transportation business.Sources said the dues being sought are more than three times the net worth of GAIL and several times the actual revenue earned.While telcos such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea may have had non-telecom revenues generated from using the government licence and spectrum, firms such as GAIL and OIL had no such revenue.The DoT is seeking  1.47 lakh crore from all telcos in past statutory dues.Besides GAIL and OIL, the DoT is seeking  40,000 crore from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The Spaniard launched his campaign to equal the Swiss great\\'s mark by dropping just five games in a 6-2, 6-3, 6-0 annihilation of Bolivian Hugo Dellien in the Australian Open first round.The Mallorcan, the first man to be world number one in three different decades, can not only match his great rival\\'s achievement, but also become the first man in the Open era to win all four Majors at least twice if he lifts the trophy again at Melbourne Park.It is a big ask for the 33-year-old Nadal, who has only won the title once before in Australia, against a tearful Federer in 2009, with four runner-up finishes to his name. \"I don\\'t care about 20 or 15 or 16. I just care about trying to keep going, keep enjoying my tennis career,\" said Nadal.\"It\\'s not like 20 is the number that I need to reach. If I reach 20, fantastic. If I reach 21, better.

He has been a finalist in Melbourne four times since winning but has struggled to get over the line, something that baffles him.\"I have been a break up twice in the fifth set and I lost. Another time I have been injured in a final, of course, against a great opponent,\" he said on why he had not been able to convert in Australia.- Main goal -Nadal, in a pink sleeveless shirt and matching shoes, was in total charge against the world number 73 Dellien, storming to a 5-0 lead in the opening set before the Bolivian held serve, then against the odds broke, before the Spaniard served out the set.Underdog Dellien was broken in the sixth game of the second set but hit back again to break Nadal for the second time in the match before the top seed again rallied to restore control with some sizzling forehands down the line. Nadal raced 3-0 up in the third set as his physicality and power shone through.The Spaniard next plays either Argentine Federico Delbonis or Portugal\\'s Joao Sousa and said he never looked further ahead than the next match. \"I think about Sousa or Delbonis, that\\'s all. I think about my practice tomorrow, try to follow up the level of tennis that I played in the third set,\" he said.\"That should be my main goal. I need to play at my highest level if I want to keep going in the tournament. \"If I am able to reach my highest level, that\\'s the thing that I have to worry about. \"If I am able to play at my highest level, normally I am able to produce some good chances. \"If not, impossible.\"',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI :Tuesday brought a flicker of hope for Indias embattled telcos with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear their petitions to modify its 24 October order that made them liable to pay up more than  1 trillion of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues by 23 January.The matter was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde on Tuesday and the case is likely to be heard next week. The telcos had filed the modification pleas on Monday.The court, however, did not comment on the status of the original payment deadline.Vodafone Idea Ltd will not make the payment by 23 January,\" said a person aware of the development, requesting anonymity.Bharti Airtel Ltd raised $3 billion earlier this month to pay the dues.The pleas filed by Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel, and Tata Teleservices seek more time to pay adjusted gross revenue (AGR) related dues. The telcos want to negotiate a sustainable payment schedule with the department of telecommunications (DoT), which has issued demand notices for revenue share, interest, and penalty.Bharti Airtel owes  35,586 crore, Vodafone Idea  50,000 crore, and Tata Teleservices, which has sold its mobile services business to Airtel, 14,000 crore.Bharti Airtels petition said it would need more time to calculate dues across 22 telecom circles over the last 15 years, which is a complex process. Vodafone Idea, meanwhile, said it does not have the resources to pay such huge amounts. As such, if suitable payment terms are not made available, it will lead to the immediate closure of one of the largest and oldest telecom companies in India, causing disruption to 300 million subscribers and putting lakhs of jobs at risk, its petition said. Mint has seen copies of both petitions.The Cellular Operators Association of India, which represents Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio, hailed the courts admission of the modification pleas as a positive move for the sector.Telcos have indicated their willingness to pay AGR dues. We are now asking for appropriate terms to make this payment. We have sought a debt package from DoT to make payments affordable. We want an adequate moratorium and a 15-year period to pay the entire AGR dues (principal and interest and penalty),\" said Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI.Emails sent to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Tata Teleservices were not answered till press time.The courts earlier verdict brought an end to the prolonged dispute between the government and telecom companies on the definition of AGR.Under Indias telecom licence rules, operators must pay licence fees and spectrum charges at 8% and 3-5% of AGR respectively. While the telcos said AGR refers only to revenues from telecom, DoT insisted that it includes all revenues. The Supreme Court upheld the governments definition, in major blow to telcos bleeding from intense competition in the last few years.The modification applications were filed after the apex court last week dismissed pleas of the operators to review its earlier judgement. The apex courts refusal to review its order has dealt a body blow to Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, which reported record losses in the September quarter as they set aside funds to pay dues. The two telcos had on Thursday also said they were evaluating the possibility of filing of curative petitions.',\n",
       " 'The new leader of Islamic State has been confirmed as Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli al-Salbi, according to officials from two intelligence services. He is one of the terror groups founding members and has led the enslavement of Iraqs Yazidi minority and has overseen operations around the globe.The Guardian has learned that Salbi was named leader hours after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October. The name that the group gave for Baghdadis replacement at the time, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi, was a nom de guerre not recognised by other senior leaders or intelligence agencies.In the three months since the raid that killed Baghdadi, a fuller picture of Salbi has been pieced together by regional and western spies, placing him at the centre of Isis decision-making  and that of its forerunners  and portraying him as a hardened veteran in the same vein as Baghdadi, unflinching in his loyalty to the extremist group.Salbi is considered to be one of the most influential ideologues among the now depleted ranks of Isis. Born into an Iraqi Turkmen family in the town of Tal Afar, he is one of the few non-Arabs among the leadership.He is also known by the nom de guerre Haji Abdullah, and in some circles as Abdullah Qardash  although Iraqi officials suggest the latter was a separate Isis figure who died two years ago.Salbi, as intelligence officials now know him, rose through the ranks helped by his background as an Islamic scholar and gave religious rulings that underwrote the genocide against Yazidis and the emptying of the Nieveh Plains in northern Iraq during the height of the Isis rampage. Salbi holds a degree in sharia law from the University of Mosul. In 2004 he was detained by US forces in Camp Bucca prison in southern Iraq where he met Baghdadi. He is believed to have at least one son.Before Baghdadis death in a US military raid in north-west Syria on 27 October, the US state department put a $5m bounty on Salbis head and on two other senior members of the group. Salbi was touted as a potential replacement for the ailing Baghdadi in August but confirmation of his appointment took several months to secure.Since then he is understood to have been trying to consolidate the new Isis leadership, nearly all of whom apart from Salbi himself are drawn from a new generation who were too young to play roles in Isiss founding battles against US forces from 2004 or in the Iraqi civil war that followed.Isis is yet to regain anything like the juggernaut-like momentum that led to it threatening the regional order after Baghdadi proclaimed himself a caliph of the Islamic world in mid-2014. However, it has shown signs of regrouping since it lost its last foothold of land in the deserts of eastern Syria in March last year.Kurdish forces in northern Iraq have warned since last summer of an increase in attacks in the centre and north of the country. Isis claimed to have carried out 106 attacks between 20 and 26 December to avenge the deaths of Baghdadi and the Isis propaganda chief, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, on the same day.A senior Iraqi Kurdish official said: Weve seen significant uptick in Isis attacks from mid last year, with the centre of gravity having now moved further south. Were now tracking on average 60 attacks a month through assassinations, roadside bombs and assaults on Iraqi security forces.Their rural networks remain very much intact; after all, Isis members in Iraq still receive monthly salaries and training in remote mountainous areas. That network allows the organisation to endure, even when militarily defeated.The hunt for Salbi has extended to Turkey where his brother, Adel Salbi, is a representative in a political party called the Turkmen Iraqi Front. The new Isis leader is thought to have maintained connections with his brother until he was named as leader.Intelligence officials have little insight into his whereabouts but suggest he is unlikely to have followed Baghdadi to Idlib province and would have preferred to stay in a small band of towns to the west of Mosul.The city of Mosul itself has been a refuge for what remains of the groups leaders and rank and file, who have attempted to melt back into communities that are steadily rebuilding after five years of war and dislocation.Another senior Isis figure who used religious credentials to offer rulings, Shifa al-Nima, was arrested last week in a Mosul suburb. He was taken to a detention centre on a flatbed truck as he weighed 254kg (nearly 40st) and was unable to walk.Iraqi officials said Nima regularly ordered the execution of clerics and security officials who did not abide by the rigid decrees of the organisation.Across the border in Syria, officials are still struggling to contain what British, French and other European officials regard as the biggest residual threat posed by Isis  two large detention centres set up to house members of the group and their families who fled its last redoubt.Al-Hol and al-Roj camps, controlled by Syrian Kurdish forces, remain hotbeds of extremism. Corners of al-Hol camp in particular remain off-limits to security forces and there have been widespread reports of hardline religious instruction being given by female members of the group regarded as irreconcilables. Kurdish sources have spoken of indoctrination taking place and other members of the camp being intimidated and harassed by hardliners.What to do with the foreign Isis prisoners in Syria, thought to number around 2,000, has vexed European officials who fear both a mass breakout from overstretched prisons and the political consequences of allowing citizens who had travelled to join Isis to return home.Britain has stripped citizenship from several of its citizens, including Shamima Begum who fled the UK for Syria when she was 15. The US has done the same to Hoda Mothana, another so-called Isis bride, who was captured in western Syria in January last year.',\n",

Capabilities take a long time to build up and this is a start.\"CDS Rawat in his remarks, however, did not mention China by name.Oceans are meant for freedom of navigation.

       " 'DUBLIN (Reuters) - Everyone knows that the global corporate tax system needs to be overhauled, Apple (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Monday, backing changes to global rules that are currently under consideration. The growth of internet giants such as Apple has pushed international tax rules to the limit, prompting the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to pursue global reforms over where multinational firms should be taxed. The reforms being examined center around the booking of profits by multinational firms in low-tax countries such as Ireland where they have bases - and where Cook was speaking on Monday - rather than where most of their customers are. I think logically everybody knows it needs to be rehauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system. Im hopeful and optimistic that they (the OECD) will find something, Cook said. Its very complex to know how to tax a multinational... We desperately want it to be fair, the Apple CEO added after receiving an inaugural award from the Irish state agency responsible for attracting foreign companies recognizing the contribution of multinationals in the country. Apple is one of Irelands largest multinational employers with 6,000 workers and both it and the Irish government have gone to court to fight a European Union order that Apple must pay 13 billion euros ($14.41 billion) in back taxes to Dublin. The appeal to the EUs second-highest court began in September and could run for years. Cook said Apples belief that law should not retrofitted was at the heart of the case and that the company had great faith in the justice system. Apples commitment to Ireland, which became its first European operation in 1980, was unshakable, Cook said. The Apple chief executive also said that more regulation was needed in the area of privacy and must go further than the 2018 European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy laws that handed regulators there significantly more powers. I think more regulation is needed in this area, it is probably strange for a business person to be talking about regulation but it has become apparent that companies will not self-police in this area, he said. We were one of the first to endorse GDPR, we think it is overall extremely good, not only for Europe. We think its necessary but not sufficient. You have to go further and that further is required to get privacy back to where it should be.  Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Alex Richardson and Louise Heavens',\n",

Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples  severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus can causepneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Chinas national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outsideChina, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend.There are nine cases of the virus in the UK. Four were located in Brighton, one in London. At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative. Of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.We dont yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we wont know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about400,000 deathseach year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. TheNHS advisesthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GPs surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is the worldwide spread of a disease. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHOs list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a window of opportunity to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Sarah BoseleyHealth editor andHannah DevlinCases were confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province in the south, heightening fears ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when more than 400 million people are expected to travel domestically and internationally.State broadcaster CCTV said on Monday evening there were seven suspected cases in other parts of the country, including Shandong in the east, and the south-western provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi and Yunnan. Five people who travelled from Wuhan were also being treated for fevers in Zhejiang province.Peoples lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed, said Chinas president, Xi Jinping, weighing in on the matter for the first time.The strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03. The current outbreak has spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea.A man was in isolation in Brisbane, Australia after being suspected of having the virus after he returned from a visit to Wuhan.Chinas National Health Commission said it had sent working groups to all provinces to oversee outbreak prevention, describing the situation as controllable. Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing and in Zhejiang province have comprehensively strengthened examination procedures. In Shenzhen, temperature checks have been put in place in airports, ports and railway stations.More than 100 patients with symptoms were waiting to be seen at the Xiehe hospital in Wuhan at 6am on Monday. If you are coming now, you have to wait between three and four hours before you can see the doctors, a hospital worker said by phone.At a hospital in Chaoyang district in Beijing, patients were being given masks and forms to fill out, detailing any recent travel to Wuhan. A nurse said preventive measures were also being taken to protect doctorsCoronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and the outbreak in Wuhan has been linked to a now-closed seafood market where live animals were reportedly sold.The World Health Organization has said an animal source was the most likely primary source of the outbreak, with some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts. Researchers worry the number of infections has been severely underestimated.The WHO said it would convene an emergency meeting in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus constituted an international health emergency.Xi Chen, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said the likelihood of human-to-human transmission had appeared large given how many cases were confirmed. Its hard to see all these cases coming from animals at the same market, Chen said.For weeks, the only reported cases were in Wuhan and areas outside mainland China, prompting many people to question whether other cities were simply not reporting or testing for the virus. Some internet users joked the virus appeared to be patriotic by only spreading beyond Chinas borders.Chen said the high cost of testing for diagnosis may have contributed to underreporting. Authorities have still not identified the source of the infection, which further complicates the governments ability to contain the outbreak. The Huanan seafood market, where thousands of traders sold products, has been closed since 1 January. But some of the detected cases are patients with no history of visiting the market.What concerns me is the source of infection. We have no idea. Thats the most important thing. Without knowing that we dont know the harm, how hard it can be, Chen said.Others fear that authorities have not moved quickly enough to contain the spread of the virus or educate the public. In Wuhan, temperature checkpoints have been installed at the airport and at train stations and bus terminals since 14 January, about five weeks after the virus was first detected.Observers and residents worry about the possibility of a cover-up worsening the outbreak, as was the case with Sars in 2003.Some residents in Wuhan have been told not to speak to media. The official Weibo account of Wuhan police said on 1 January that eight internet users who spread false information online causing adverse social impacts had been dealt with according to the law.But Chinese health officials have made improvements since the Sars episode. In response to a bird flu outbreak in 2013, authorities quickly worked with the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fresh food markets were shut down but the outbreak was exacerbated by poultry sales into smaller, less-regulated markets.The situation is complicated by the fact that farmers are unlikely to be compensated by the government or give up their sick animals. Its not about a cover-up. Rather its about a lack of capacity and about a lack of enforced regulation, said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor focusing on health security at City University of Hong Kong.At the moment, it is a bad flu. Yes, it is something to be concerned about and it is probably going to get worse in terms of infections and mortality, but again its winter, he said. It is likely to spread but we are still a long way off the levels of Sars or bird flu.The state-run Global Times said in an editorial on Sunday: In the early days of Sars, there was a cover-up and delayed reporting. Such things can never be repeated again in China.Authorities have advised residents in the run-up to the lunar new year, which falls on 25 January, to be on the lookout for symptoms including fever, coughs, breathing difficulties and pneumonia. Millions of people will crisscross the country during a weeklong public holiday starting on 24 January, in what is known as humanitys largest migration. Some of those travelling will have set off already.The WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions and Chinese authorities have not yet issued any. Still, not all residents were comforted by government assurances.With this huge amount of spring festival travel, why are there not any prevention measures? one wrote on Weibo. On the Douban forum, another observed that few people at Wuhan train station were wearing masks. Traders at the now-closed suspected seafood market in Wuhan said they were not overly worried, seeing the virus as little more than the common cold. We start early, at 2am or 3am. We put our hands in the cold water. If we catch a cold, we dont pay it much attention, said Li, 52, who has operated a stall in Huanan for most of the past decade.Li said that starting from late December, the property developer that owned the market asked renters to wear masks to work and avoid going to crowded places. Im not worried, said Li. My grandchildren all live in Wuhan and we dont believe it. Its just rumours.However, Li said some tenants who might have shown symptoms of the virus were unlikely to have reported themselves, fearing the impact on their business and being quarantined. Most people wouldnt say if they had it, he said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang',\n",
       " 'KFC has apologised for an ad in Australia that shows two young boys staring with their mouths agape as a woman adjusts her breasts.The apology was issued after Collective Shout, an Australian group which campaigns against the objectification of women, labelled the ad a regression to tired and archaic stereotypes where young women are sexually objectified for male pleasure.The 15-second ad features a young woman checking her reflection in the tinted windows of a parked car, apparently not realising anyone is inside the vehicle.As she adjusts her breasts in a low-cut top, the window lowers to show the boys staring, open mouthed, as an older woman looks on disapprovingly from the drivers seat.The younger woman is also pictured checking out how her bottom looks in a very short playsuit.The ad has been running on television and has also been shared on the fast food chains YouTube channel.In a short statement issued on Tuesday, KFC said: We apologise if anyone was offended by our latest commercial. Our intention was not to stereotype women and young boys in a negative light.The Collective Shout spokeswoman Melinda Liszewski said the ad was a regression to tired and archaic stereotypes where young women were sexually objectified for male pleasure; and males were helplessly transfixed when confronted with the opportunity to ogle a womans body.Ads like this reinforce the false idea that we cant expect better from boys. It is another manifestation of the boys will be boys trope, hampering our ability to challenge sexist ideas which contribute to harmful behaviour towards women and girls, Liszewski said.The research is solid: attitudes shape behaviour. A growing number of reports show how reinforcing of gender stereotypes  including in advertising  contributes to a lesser view of women, resulting in their mistreatment.KFC has not confirmed if it will stop using the ad.',\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnsons government was defeated in parliament on Monday for the first time since a December election, with the upper chamber voting in favour of a move to protect the rights of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit. Johnsons Conservatives won a large majority in the lower chamber, the House of commons, at the Dec. 12 vote and lawmakers there quickly approved the legislation needed to ratify his exit deal with Brussels earlier this month. The legislation is now passing through the House of Lords, where the government does not have a majority. While the upper chamber is not expected to block passage of the bill, it is seeking to make changes. Members of the Lords voted by 270 to 229 in favour of a change put forward by the pro-EU Liberal Democrats which would give eligible EU citizens in Britain an automatic right to stay after Brexit, rather than having to apply to the government to do so. It would also ensure they are given physical proof of their right to remain. The government has said only that people will be given a secure digital status which links to their passport. Last week, European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said Britain had told him it was looking into the possibility of providing a physical document to EU citizens but Johnsons spokesman said he was not aware of any plans. The government later suffered two further defeats in the Lords, over the power of British courts to depart from judgements of the European Court of Justice after Brexit. It is facing another defeat on Tuesday, when members are due to vote on an amendment which would ensure protections for child refugees, a promise made by Johnsons predecessor, Theresa May, but absent from his legislation. Any changes to the legislation made by the House of Lords have to go back to the House of Commons to be approved and could still be overturned.

       " 'YANGON/21 (Reuters) - A government-appointed panel established in Myanmar to probe allegations of abuses in Rakhine state in 2017 that drew global outrage said on Monday they had found no evidence of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority. More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine state during weeks of brutal violence, during which the United Nations says gang rapes and mass killings were carried out with genocidal intent. Hundreds of villages were burned to the ground and later razed and scraped. Although the panel acknowledged war crimes had taken place, rights groups and Rohingya leaders dismissed the report as a whitewash days ahead of an expected ruling by the U.Ns highest court on a genocide case against the country. The commission of inquiry said there were reasonable grounds to conclude members of the security forces among multiple actors were responsible for possible war crimes and serious human rights violations during a military-led crackdown against the group in 2017. These included the killing of innocent villagers and destruction of their homes, it said. But in its statement, issued to mark the finalization of a full report based on interviews with villagers and members of the security forces, the panel blamed Rohingya militants for attacking 30 police posts and provoking the crackdown and described the situation as an internal armed conflict. The ICOE has not found any evidence suggesting that these killings or acts of displacement were committed pursuant to an intent or plan to destroy the Muslim or any other community in northern Rakhine State, the panels statement read. There is insufficient evidence to argue, much less conclude, that the crimes committed were undertaken with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, or with any other requisite mental state for the international crime of genocide.  Myanmar President Win Myint said in a statement on Tuesday the government concurred with the findings of the commission and vowed to pursue further investigations, specifically into alleged crimes by civilians and Rohingya militants.  He said he had given the report to the army chief, so that the military might extend ongoing investigations, he said, adding that the executive summary would be made public. The army began a rare trial in November of soldiers and officers from a regiment deployed to Gu Dar Pyin village, the site of an alleged massacre of Rohingya. Two spokesmen for the military could not be reached for comment by Reuters. In Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled Myanmar have taken refuge, a Rohingya leader, Dil Mohammed, described the report as a whitewash. We have been persecuted for decades. So many of our people were killed, our women were raped, our children were thrown into fire and our homes were torched. If it is not genocide, what is it? he said. The International Court of Justice, the highest U.N. court, will this week issue a decision on a request for emergency measures in a genocide case against the country. Gambia filed the suit in November alleging Myanmar was committing an ongoing genocide against the Rohingya.  The commission of enquiry was formed in 2018 as the country faced growing calls for accountability. The government appointed two local and two international members  Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, a former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations. Myanmar says the international efforts violate its sovereignty and has vowed to carry out its own investigations into the allegations. But few have been punished so far. Seven soldiers jailed for 10 years for killing 10 Rohingya men and boys in the village of Inn Din were granted early release last November, after serving less than a year in prison. The problem is, according to Myanmars constitution, the military is the only institution that can investigate its own members for breaches of military discipline, Maung Maung Soe, a political analyst based in the commercial capital of Yangon, told Reuters. We will be able to solve this problem only if a court martial seriously engages and takes specific actions on those who committed war crimes.

       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin accelerated a shake-up of Russias political system on Monday, submitting a constitutional reform blueprint to parliament that will create a new center of power outside the presidency.  Putin also replaced Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, who had held the role since 2006, a move suggesting his planned changes could reach beyond the political system and the government. In a surprise move, Putin announced plans for reforms last week. Long-time ally Dmitry Medvedev then resigned as prime minister along with the government, saying he wanted to allow room for the president to make the changes.  Putins proposed changes are widely seen as giving him scope to retain influence once his term expires in 2024 though he said at the weekend he did not favor the Soviet-era practice of having leaders for life who die in office. In draft amendments submitted to the State Duma lower house, Putin offered a glimpse of how his reforms look on paper. Under his plan, some of the presidents broad powers would be clipped and parliaments powers expanded. In one of the biggest changes, the status of the State Council, now a low-profile body that advises the president, would for the first time be enshrined in the constitution. Putin, 67, has not disclosed what he plans to do once he leaves the Kremlin. One option could be to head the beefed-up State Council once he leaves the presidency.   Under his proposals, the president would pick the make-up of the State Council which would be handed broader powers to determine the main directions of domestic and foreign policy. His changes also envisage preventing any future president serving more than two terms. Putin first became president in 2000 and is now in his fourth term as head of state.  Chaika, 68, has long been one of the most powerful figures in the Russian justice system and has faced allegations of corruption from the political opposition which he denies. The Kremlin said Chaika was moving to another, unspecified, job and proposed Igor Krasnov, deputy head of the Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, to replace him.   Krasnov, 44, has led high-profile criminal investigations including the inquiry into the murder of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, who was shot dead near the Kremlin in 2015.  Russias opposition said on Monday it planned to stage a protest march next month against the reforms. Society needs a big and genuinely mass protest, wrote opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who said Putins changes amounted to a move to rule forever. The Duma is due to discuss Putins amendments on Thursday.  Putin has said the public will be invited to vote on the proposed changes. Andrei Klishas, a senior lawmaker involved in drafting the legislation, said the vote might be held once parliament approved the legislation, the RIA news agency reported.

       " 'Kuala Lumpur/Mumbai: Thousands of tonnes of refined palm oil are delayed or stuck at various Indian ports after the world\\'s biggest edible oil buyer placed restrictions on imports amid a diplomatic row with key supplier Malaysia, multiple sources told Reuters.India announced the curbs on imports of refined palm oil on Jan. 8 in a bid to help domestic refiners raise their plant utilisation rates, according to industry officials familiar with the matter. In a typical year India relies on imports for almost all of its supply of the vegoil used in everything from soap to cookies.But Malaysia, the world\\'s second-biggest producer and exporter of palm oil, has publicly bridled at New Delhi\\'s move even as India has stepped up orders from Indonesia, according to Refinitiv data. India has been its biggest market for the last five years, and the row sent benchmark Malaysian palm futures to their worst weekly fall in more than 11 years on Friday.\"More than 30,000 tonnes have been stuck at various (Indian) ports. All theses vessels were loaded before the government restricted imports of refined palm oil,\" said a Mumbai-based vegetable oil dealer, who declined to be named citing company policy.\"Usually customs officials allow unloading of commodities that are in transit before any change in regulation. But in the case of refined palm oil, there is some confusion and that is leading to delays.\"A source in New Delhi with direct knowledge of the matter said the restrictions mean importers will need a licence to buy, a tool that could be used to deny or delay shipments from Malaysia. The person declined to be identified citing the sensitivity of the matter.Another vegetable oil importer said some vessels were stuck at Kolkata port in eastern India, with some others on the west coast. In one incident at Mangalore port on the west coast, crude palm oil was unloaded from a vessel, while refined oil was not permitted ashore, said the importer, who also declined to be named citing the sensitive nature of the situation.Reuters could not ascertain which vessels contained the cargoes that have been held up at Kolkata and Mangalore, nor who the buyers were. A source in Kuala Lumpur, who requested anonymity citing the sensitivity of the matter, said the refined palm oil was from both Indonesia and Malaysia.Officials at Kolkata and Mangalore ports did not immediately respondto anemailseeking comment.Malaysia\\'s Sime Darby Plantation , the world\\'s largest oil palm planter by land size, said none of its refined palm oil was stuck at Indian ports. The company, which has operations in both Malaysia and Indonesia, exported more than 436,000 tonnes of refined palm oil to India last year.Sudhakar Desai, president of Indian Vegetable Oil Producers\\' Association, said refined palm cargoes that reached before the restrictions were placed had been cleared but none after that.\"We don\\'t think any licenses have been issued for any origin,\" Desai said.A spokeswoman for India\\'s trade ministry did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.',\n",

       " 'The IPL snub was hard to digest, out-of-favour India batsman Manoj Tiwary said after his monumental triple ton in a Ranji Trophy game on Monday. Tiwary made an unbeaten 303 for Bengal against Hyderabad but, at 34, and given the Indian teams settled look, even this may not be enough for a national comeback. It was difficult to digest the fact (IPL snub). But thats the reality. Obviously, it feels bad when you see so many youngsters playing and I sit back at home watching. Those shots I could have hit. Its the harsh reality for me, Tiwary said.The franchise management looked for something different.Tiwary became only the second player from Bengal, after Devang Gandhi (323), to score a triple ton. He preferred to remain optimistic, urging the selectors to look at his consistency and quality.Also read:Joe Root hails brilliant England after crushing win over South AfricaAt the moment India are winning. Its difficult with the way India are shaping right now. But anything is possible in this world.Confidence is my strength. I always have to keep hope. Age is just a number for me, the 34-year-old said after his unbeaten knock. Pointing to his 46 against Andhra on a Eden Gardens greentop, Tiwary said selectors often go for individual brilliance rather than seeing the quality of knocks.It was quite special. Even India Test batsman Hanuma Vihari (23) failed there. If it was difficult for him, then it would have been more difficult for us. it was challenging conditions. So its about the quality of knocks.Its difficult to say about my comeback... I cannot select myself. But for someone with 8000-plus runs (8752) at 50-plus average (in first class cricket), you should see the consistency, the quality of knocks and not just individual brilliance.Spending 10 hours and 30 minutes at the crease before Bengal declared at 635 for seven, Tiwary struck 30 fours and five sixes in his knock.Also read:Ishant injury adds to Delhi woes as Vidarbha take complete controlI have always believed in my abilities and hardwork and my job is to keep scoring runs and win for the team, said Tiwary, who last played for India in 2015, when a second-string national side toured Zimbabwe for an ODI series.Before that, Tiwary was given a short run in the ODIs during the 2011-12 season, a time when he notched up a 104 against the West Indies in Chennai before being left out.Tiwary had last expressed his frustration after he was ignored for the four-day matches against South Africa A, the three-team Duleep Trophy, and the quadrangular series involving Australia A and South Africa A.Tiwary did not feature in any of the side despite scoring well in the 2017-18 domestic season when he aggregated 507 runs at 126.7 - the highest-ever List-A average in a single domestic season in India.He also averaged more than 100 in both the Vijay Hazare Trophy and the Deodhar Trophy, a feat that no other batsman has achieved in a season.Also read:Du Plessis opens up on retirement rumours after defeat to EnglandTiwary dedicated the knock to his one and half year old son Yuvaan, whose name was inscribed prominently on his bat.This knock is very special for my family and to my son especially. Whatever I do now is for Yuvaan. He has been lucky for me. This knock also came from the bat with Yuvaans name, he said.I would rate this behind my 104 -- that was for India (against West Indies). But first 300, pretty happy. I played in a crucial and difficult situation in the morning.My role was important to hang in there and see off the new ball. Its a milestone I will cherish forever, he said as he had a muted celebration after reaching the landmark.In the morning, with Tiwary on 156, coach and mentor Arun Lal had reminded him of Gandhis 323.I never wanted to surpass his record...

Alizadeh, who won taekwondo bronze at the Rio 2016 Olympics, had been training in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven, after leaving Iran several weeks earlier. Kimia has decided to continue in Germany, Dutch national taekwondo coach Mimoun el Boujjoufi told Reuters on Monday.

       " 'A 15-year-old male tiger named Zalim who was famously known for rearing orphan cubs died of a suspected territorial fight in the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) in Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan.  This is the second tiger death this year: On January 2 in a rare instance a 12-year old tiger had killed a 15-year old tigress at Sajjangarh Biological Park in Udaipur. The tiger also known as Kumar had barged into the enclosure of tigress Damini and killed her. Field Director, RTR, Manoj Parashar said the body of the tiger (T-25) was found in Sanwta village area of RTR on Monday. The post mortem has been conducted and the cause of death was suspected to be a territorial fight. The tigers head bones was crushed and canine marks are there.He said it was suspected that he engaged in a fight with a 10-year-old male tiger T-66, who along with female tigress T-54 is moving in the same area. Parashar said that T-25s  movement was lately seen in Khandar area of the Reserve.Zalim will be fondly remembered for rearing orphan twin cubs of T-5 tigress, who died in 2011. A forest official recalled that there was serious concern over the survival of the two female cubs, which were around three-months old at that time. It was then Zalim came into the picture and started protecting them from other tigers and animals. He used to stay close to them and even allowed to eat with him, which is a rare phenomenon, according to the official. The cubs were than named Bina -1 and Bina-2 and later shifted to the Sariska Tiger Reserve. They are now known as ST-9 and ST-10. In 2019, five tigers died in Rajasthan. In January, the body of 5-year-old Tiger T-85 aka Pacman was found in Khandar range with severe injury marks; it was suspected that the animal got involved in a territorial fight. In October, 3-year-old Veeru (T-109) succumbed to injuries after a suspected fight with another 8-year-old tiger T-42, aka Fateh. In September, a lioness Suzzanne suffering from Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), died at the Nahargarh Biological Park; than nine and half-month-old tiger cub and White Tigress, fondly known as Sita died there.

Three Nepali guides were among the group struck by an avalanche on Friday along the popular trekking route at the base of Mount Annapurna, the worlds 10th highest mountain, at 8,091 meters (26,545 feet).      A military helicopter flew an army search and rescue team and sherpa climbers to the area, but bad weather, heavy snow and continuous avalanches prevented them from landing, said Mira Acharya, a tourism department official. It is a big disaster and the government is concerned about the safety of tourists, Acharya told Reuters. Rescuers are on standby for a fresh search. The search will continue when the weather improves, she added.  About 200 people, including 140 foreign hikers, were evacuated from the area at the weekend, police official Binod Sharma said. Avalanches and bad weather had also prevented a search on Sunday by seven rescuers from the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal, who reached the site at Deurali, about 150 km (90 miles) northwest of the capital, Kathmandu.  A helicopter equipped with a device to track signs of the trekkers in the snow also failed to pinpoint where the group of seven went missing, said Suraj Paudyal, an official of a private rescue company.  In 2018, five South Koreans and four Nepali guides on a Himalayan climbing expedition were flung to their deaths after a huge block of ice crashed over a cliff into a narrow mountain gorge. The winter trekking season in Nepal, home to eight of the worlds 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, is drawing to a close this month.

       " 'OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Finance Minister Siv Jensen and her right-wing Progress Party will resign from the government over a cabinet decision to help bring a woman suspected of Islamic State affiliation back home to Norway, Jensen said on Monday. The resignation robs Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg of her parliamentary majority and could make the country more difficult to govern, but Solberg still plans to remain in office as head of a minority coalition. I brought us into government, and Im now bringing the party out, Jensen told a news conference. There had been too many compromises, Jensen said, while adding she wants to have a close dialogue with the prime minister in the future. The Norwegian crown currency was largely unchanged after the announcement. Prime Minister Erna Solberg said she would remain in office as head of a minority three-party coalition. Most Norwegian governments since the 1970s have ruled with a minority in parliament, including Solberg between 2013 and January 2019. Jensens departure was triggered by the decision, announced last week, that the Norwegian woman and her two children would receive help to return to Norway from Syria so that one of the children could receive medical treatment. The woman, who left Norway in 2013, was arrested on her return on suspicion of being a member of the Islamist militant group that briefly controlled a territory the size of Britain across Iraq and Syria. While Progress had offered to help the children, the populist party sought to deny any government assistance for adults seeking to return home after joining Islamist groups abroad or marrying foreign fighters. Decisions on whether to help women with IS ties return from Syria has caused controversy in Europe, including in Finland where the recently appointed government settled on a compromise to decide each case individually. The Norwegian woman, who has not been named, has denied the  charges against her and will fully cooperate with police during interrogation, her lawyer has said. Jensens exit, along with six other Progress cabinet ministers, leaves Solberg with a string of posts to fill, including that of oil and energy minister to oversee Western Europes biggest oil and gas industry. At the finance ministry, the new appointee will chart the course for the worlds largest sovereign wealth fund, with assets of $1.1 trillion.

       " 'The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world economy is increasingly vulnerable to the impact of the climate emergency as the Washington-based organisation downgraded its forecasts for 2020 and 2021.Urging governments to make greater strides to reduce carbon emissions and build green infrastructure, the IMF said one of the main risks to its forecasts came from the growing costs of the climate crisis and the harm caused by protectionist trade policies.It also cited political wrangling between the US and Iran, and the potential for social unrest to spread across the Middle East as further threats to the global economic outlook.In its half-yearly health check on the global economy, the IMF said: Weather-related disasters such as tropical storms, floods, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires have imposed severe humanitarian costs and livelihood loss across multiple regions in recent years.Climate change, the driver of the increased frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters, already endangers health and economic outcomes, and not only in the directly affected regions.It could pose challenges to other areas that may not yet feel the direct effects, including by contributing to cross-border migration or financial stress (for instance, in the insurance sector). A continuation of the trends could inflict even bigger losses across more countries.Speaking in Davos at the World Economic Forum, the IMFs chief economist, Gita Gopinath, said the climate risk was near and present and a major issue that demands that governments step up.The warning came as the IMF said the global economy would grow by an estimated 3.3% in 2020, down from a previous forecast of 3.4%. Growth in 2021 is expected to be 0.2 percentage points lower than originally forecast at 3.4%.The escalating tit-for-tat tariff war between the US and China last year was mostly to blame for a 0.1 percentage point cut in the estimate for growth for 2019 to 2.9%.As recently as 2017, the global economy grew by 3.8%. Before the financial crisis in 2006, it was expanding at the much faster rate of 5.5%.The UK is expected to grow only modestly and in line with the IMFs previous forecast at 1.3% last year, 1.4% this year and 1.5% next year. This is based on an orderly exit from the EU later this year and a smooth transition to a new trading relationship from 2021.Citing other downside threats to its forecast, the report referred to the possible breakdown in US/China relations following a first-phase deal last week, further trade sanctions by the US on Europe, and the spread of social unrest. All of these factors could put in jeopardy the recovery from last years weak growth over the next two years, the IMF said.Gopinath said that since the UK election result last month, the IMF had downgraded the threat from a no-deal Brexit, offsetting trade tensions in other parts of the world. Reductions in interest rates by 49 central banks last year had added around 0.5 percentage points to global growth.The first-phase trade deal between the US and China had reduced the negative impact of protectionist policies built into the forecast by 0.3 percentage points, she added.While a long manufacturing recession in China, the US and much of Europe appeared to be coming to an end, or at least not deteriorating further, the downbeat report said a recovery would be weak, especially in the usually buoyant emerging market economies.In reports published earlier this month, the UN and the World Bank signalled weaker growth this year, citing ongoing trade protectionism and a growing debt crisis for creating uncertainty and limiting business investment.The IMF said the downward revision in the near term reflected negative surprises to economic activity in a few emerging market economies, notably India, which led to a reassessment of growth prospects over the next two years. In a few cases, this reassessment also reflects the impact of increased social unrest.South Africa, Mexico and India were among countries suffering significantly from the uncertainty that dominated trading relationships in 2019.It said the prospects for a durable resolution to trade and technology tensions between the US and China remained elusive, despite sporadic favourable news on ongoing negotiations.It added: Further deterioration in economic relations between the US and its trading partners (seen, for example, in frictions between the United States and the European Union), or in trade ties involving other countries, could undermine the nascent bottoming-out of global manufacturing and trade, leading global growth to fall short of the baseline.

       " 'Rohit Sharmas love affair with Australia continued after the India opener made a well-paced 119 to help India chase down the 287-run target and win the 3rd ODI against Australia at Bengaluru on Sunday. The win meant, India clinched the series 2-1 after being 0-1 down. Impressed with Rohit Sharmas brilliance with the bat on a Bengaluru track which offered more turn than usual, former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar said batting comes naturally to him.Rohit Sharma made 119 and put on a key 137-run second-wicket stand with skipper Virat Kohli, who made 89, as India reached home in 47.3 overs.When Rohit is on song then he doesnt care whether the ball is good or bad because he has so much of time, he has so much of elegance when he plays the shots. It (batting) comes very easy and naturally to him, said Shoaib Akhtar on his Youtube channel.Also Watch l Ind vs Aus | It was one of the most calculated partnerships with Rohit: Virat KohliAlso Read: Pants position in doubt? Kohli confirms Rahul as keeper for NZ tourAkhtar further stated that Rohits ability to upper cut fast deliveries reminded him of that famous Sachin Tendulkar upper cut of 2003 ODI World Cup India vs Pakistan match in Centurion. Sachin had deposited Akhtars short delivery for a six over third man. You saw his ruthlessness today. Usne maar maar k bharta nikal dia. He hit Mitchell Starc, he went after Cummins. The cut shot that he hit reminded me of Tendulkars six, added Akhtar.This is not the first time a comparison between Sachin and Rohits upper cut has been drawn.

The short and wide delivery was there to hit but Rohit had no intentions of keeping it down.Rohit hit 8 fours and 6 sixes in his innings and completed his eighth century against Australia. He now has the joint 2nd most centuries with Virat Kohli against Australia. The record belongs to Sachin Tendulkar, who has 9.During the course of the innings Rohit also became the 3rd fastest to reach 9000 ODI runs. He finally fell to Adam Zampas leg spin as the senior batsman attempted a big hit but the ball top-edged off his bat to be caught by Mitchell Starc at long-on.But that didnt stop India from reaching the target with ease mainly due to Virat Kohlis brilliance and a cameo in the end from Shreyas Iyer. On days like this, if it comes off, it looks good, Rohit said after the match.It was an important game, the decider, and we wanted to come out and enjoy ourselves. To keep that Australian batting under 290 was a great effort. Once KL got out, it needed nobody better than the captain himself,Rohit added.',\n",

       " 'New Delhi: The outbreak of a mysterious respiratory illness caused by a novel virus - previously unknown - has claimed at least three lives and sickened nearly many people in Wuhan. The SARS-like virus is associated with coronaviruses that affect the respiratory tract and has spread to other cities in China, including Beijing and Shenzhen. Chinese authorities have reported a surge in cases of coronavirus infection with nearly 140 new cases in just two days.So, the total number of people confirmed for the mysterious illness caused by the novel coronavirus now crosses 200 in China. Meanwhile, an Indian woman, a school teacher, became the first foreigner to contract the virus in China. The patient, Preeti Maheshwari, who has been on a ventilator in the intensive care unit, type 1 respiratory failure and developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.Preliminary investigations have revealed that the infection is a coronavirus - a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Common signs of infection are fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, etc. Coronaviruses can cause respiratory symptoms, ranging from a mild cold to pneumonia to even death.The virus (also called 2019-nCoV) in question appears to be somewhere in the middle in terms of severity. When we see a new coronavirus, we want to know how severe are the symptoms - this is more than cold-like symptoms and that is a concern but it is not as severe as Sars, Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh was quoted as saying by the BBC. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus revealed that it is more closely associated with SARS - than any other human coronavirus.According to prof Woolhouse, some possible reasons why the outbreak occurs in China could be due to the size and density of the population and close contact with animals that harbour risky viruses. It may be noted that the current outbreak has been linked to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market, in Wuhan.On Monday, 20 January 2020, Chinese expertshaveconfirmed that the SARS-like virus is contagious between humans as the virus spreads across the country,fueling fears of a major outbreak.Earlier, the WHO had said an animal source seemed to be the most likely primary source with some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.While there is much to learn about the new coronavirus, WHO suggests that individuals, including health workers,adopt basic guidelines to reduce the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections:In the absence of specific treatment or a cure for respiratory illness, its important to take steps that can help you stay safe and reduce the risk of infection.

The question is how best to approach this,\" Pichai said, according to a transcript of his speech at a Brussel-based think tank.He noted that there\\'s an important role for governments to play and that as the European Union and the US start drawing up their own approaches to regulation, international alignment\" of any eventual rules will be critical. He did not provide specific proposals.Pichai spoke on the same day he was scheduled to meet the EUs powerful competition regulator, Margrethe Vestager. She\\'s also due to meet Microsoft President Brad Smith separately on Monday.Vestager has in previous years hit the Silicon Valley giant with multibillion-dollar fines for allegedly abusing its market dominance to choke off competition.

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it could quit the global nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if European countries refer it to the U.N. Security Council over a nuclear agreement, a move that would overturn diplomacy in its confrontation with the West. The 1968 NPT has been the foundation of global nuclear arms control since the Cold War, including a 2015 deal Iran signed with world powers that offered it access to global trade in return for accepting curbs to its atomic program. The fate of the 2015 pact has been in doubt since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of it and reimposed sanctions. Iran has responded by scaling back its commitments, although it says it wants the pact to survive. Britain, France and Germany declared Iran in violation of the 2015 pact last week and have launched a dispute mechanism that could eventually see the matter referred back to the Security Council and the reimposition of U.N. sanctions. If the Europeans continue their improper behavior or send Irans file to the Security Council, we will withdraw from the NPT, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said, according to comments carried by IRNA and other Iranian news agencies. He also said Iran could take other steps before withdrawing from the NPT, although he did not specify them. The nuclear dispute has been at the heart of an escalation between Washington and Tehran which blew up into military confrontation in recent weeks. The 190-member NPT bans signatories other than the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France from acquiring nuclear weapons, in return for allowing them to pursue peaceful nuclear programs for power generation, overseen by the United Nations. The only country ever to declare its withdrawal from the NPT was North Korea, which expelled nuclear inspectors and openly tested atomic weapons. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan never signed up, nor did Israel, which does not say whether it has nuclear weapons but is widely presumed to have them. The West has long accused Iran of seeking to develop nuclear arms. Tehran denies this and says its goal is to master the whole process of generating electricity from nuclear energy. A steady escalation over Irans nuclear plans flared into tit-for-tat military action this month, with Trump ordering a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, prompting Iran to fire missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. During a state of alert, Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner in error. Amid that escalation - one of the biggest since Irans 1979 revolution - Tehran has faced mounting pressure from European states which say they want to save the 2015 nuclear deal. They have also indicated a readiness to back Trumps call for a broader deal with Iran that goes beyond its nuclear plans. Despite the ill will that we see from some European countries the door of negotiations with them has not been closed and the ball is in the court of these countries, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. But he also told a news conference: I dont think Iran is ready to negotiate under the conditions they have in mind. Since Washington withdrew from the deal, Trump began a policy of maximum pressure, saying a broader deal should be negotiated on nuclear issues, Irans missile program and Iranian activities in the Middle East. U.S. sanctions have crippled Irans economy, slashing its oil exports. Iran has long said it would not negotiate with Washington while sanctions are in place. Tehran has repeatedly held talks with European officials to find ways to keep the nuclear agreement alive, but has blamed the Europeans for failing to guarantee economic benefits that Iran was meant to receive in return for curbing nuclear work. The European powers claims about Iran violating the deal are unfounded, Mousavi said. Whether Iran will further decrease its nuclear commitments will depend on other parties and whether Irans interests are secured under the deal. In a report on a parliamentary website, Irans foreign minister said steps to scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal were now over. Britain has said a Trump deal could replace the 2015 deal, and France has called for broad talks to end the crisis. Iran says it cannot negotiate with Trump, who broke promises by repudiating the deal reached under his predecessor Barack Obama. Mousavi repeated Irans rejection of a Trump deal. The fact that a persons name is put on an agreement shows theyre not familiar with the conditions. An agreement with a person doesnt mean anything, he said.

At least three other people were taken to hospital with burns after the incident in the Mini Hotel Caramel, which is located in the basement of a residential building, the regions investigative committee said.  A doctor treating the victims, Andrei Babikov, said a 33-year-old woman had burns covering 35% of her body. Two men aged 28 and 35 were in a less serious condition.   Regional governor Maxim Reshetnikov said it was a terrible accident.  We will conduct the necessary checks with law enforcement and monitoring services, he said on Instagram. Special thanks go to the rescue workers, who themselves received burns in pulling people out. Video posted on social media showed thick steam billowing out of the hotels entrance in the early hours of Monday morning, with emergency services in attendance. Investigators opened a criminal investigation to establish whether the deaths resulted from negligence. The RIA news agency reported that the heating pipe that exploded had been in operation since 1962 and had broken repeatedly in the past, citing a source in the Perm emergency services.  There were no victims in previous explosions, the source said. It was not replaced, only repaired.

       " 'The complex financial schemes that helped Africas richest woman amass a fortune at vast cost to the Angolan state can be revealed for the first time after a huge leak of confidential documents from her business empire.Isabel dos Santos, who is known as the princess in Angola, the oil-rich nation her father ruled as president for almost four decades, has long denied that her estimated $2.2bn (1.7bn) fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption.However, an investigation by the Guardian and journalists in 20 countries, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), suggests Dos Santos benefited from extraordinary opportunities afforded to her by the government of her father, Jos Eduardo dos Santos, before he stood down as president in September 2017.The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the Guardian, the BBC and the Portuguese newspaperExpresso.The businesswoman, who spends much of her time in London, controls interests across Africa and Europe spanning banking, telecoms, TV, cement, diamonds, alcohol, supermarkets and real estate.The Luanda Leaks are based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts that was obtained initially by the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), an anti-corruption charity whose work with key witnesses helped topple the South African leader Jacob Zuma. The trove was then shared with the ICIJ.Dos Santos and her husband, the businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo, say computers belonging to their employees and legal advisers were hacked. They say they are the subjects of a politically motivated witch-hunt led by Angolas new president. Through their lawyers, they rejected any allegation of wrongdoing, and vehemently denied being financed by state money. There is an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated, its completely unfounded, Dos Santos told BBC News. I can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from contracts or public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds.Dokolo described the government actions as armageddon and a risk to the economy. The couple say their businesses employ thousands of people in Angola and are among the countrys biggest tax contributors. We have worked and invested in this country, more than many others, he said.In an open letter, Jos Eduardo dos Santos rejected allegations of wrongdoing, saying he had not transferred to himself, or to any other entity, money from the state.After a seven-month-investigation, the Guardian, working alongside outlets including the BBC, the New York Times and Portugals Expresso newspaper, has uncovered documents that raise questions over preferential deals and lucrative transactions with the Angolan state worth hundreds of millions of dollars.The material reveals an opaque network of about 400 companies, many of them offshore, connected to Dos Santos, Dokolo and their associates, and the assistance given to the couple in managing them by a coterie of European and American management consultants, accountants and lawyers.The documents appear to suggest that: The state oil company Sonangol sold Dokolo what has become the couples most valuable asset: a stake in the Portuguese oil corporation Galp, now worth 750m after an initial loan-backed payment of just 11m. A total of $115m in payments to consultancy firms, ordered while Dos Santos was chair of the state oil company, were routed through a Dubai company controlled by her associates. A business venture with the state diamond company allegedly resulted in $200m of public debt propping up an ailing Swiss jewellery brand partly owned by Dokolo. Two Dos Santos companies and their subcontractors stood to collect up to $500m in fees from a Dubai-style real estate development in the Angolan capital, Luanda, that was later cancelled by the new president for over-invoicing and disproportionate compensation.Three weeks ago, Angolas attorney general announced a freeze on the assets of Dos Santos, Dokolo and their chief adviser, alleging that their dealings with the countrys publicly owned oil and diamond companies had harmed the state to the tune of $1bn.Angolan prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into her actions while at the helm of the state oil company, Sonangol, in September. They are working with counterparts in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, the US and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace assets, prevent money transfers and gather information.Dos Santos says she is the subject of a witch-hunt by Angolas government, designed to neutralise her as a potential political opponent. On Wednesday, she provoked speculation about a bid for the presidency, telling a TV interviewer it was possible she would run for office.However, Dos Santos has not visited Angola for more than a year. A prosecutor told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso she was thought to have left the country hours after receiving a request from prosecutors to appear for questioning in July 2018. Through her lawyers, Dos Santos said she had no record of having received any such request, and that there was no question of her having refused to meet prosecutors.Dos Santos and her half-brothers and sisters are among the most prominent members of the oligarchy of powerful families in Angola. Her father came to office in 1979 as head of the Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). After the end of the civil war in 2002, President Dos Santos and the MPLA consolidated power by bringing the most valuable sectors of the economy into government ownership.The spoils were shared with a select group with links to politics and the military. As a result, Africas second-largest oil producing nation became known as one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, ranking near the bottom of the Transparency International corruption perceptions index. These are the classic symptoms of a captured state, said Steve Goodrich, a senior research manager at Transparency International UK, after reviewing the Luanda Leaks findings. Here we have industry and politics all in one family, with no apparent separation of powers.The leak includes data from Fidequity, a team of advisers who acted as a family office for the couple, administering their empire from plush premises above a Louis Vuitton salesroom in Lisbon.As the couple grew richer, emails and board minutes show the number of banks prepared to have them as clients dwindled. The data indicates that top-tier lenders severed ties after the Dos Santos regime was ruled a corruption risk by compliance departments.Company service providers in the Netherlands and the Isle of Man also turned down their business, the files suggest. Dokolo says he has been unable to open bank accounts under his own name in London and Paris since 2001.Other European companies appear to have taken a different approach, helping the couple move money and win lucrative contracts from the Angolan state. The blue chip firms PwC and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) collected millions in fees, providing services such as auditing of accounts and management consultancy.PwC, which handled auditing and accounts for Dokolo companies in Malta, Switzerland and the Netherlands, said it had opened an internal investigation in response to the very serious and concerning allegations and taken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the Dos Santos family.BCG said senior partners conducted regular reviews. We are proud of and take responsibility for our work, and are strict in adhering to our policies and values, a spokesperson said.Since taking over the leadership of the country and its ruling party, with the blessing of Jos Eduardo dos Santos, the new president, Joo Loureno, has vowed to fight the cancer of corruption. The most high-profile targets of his anti-graft drive have been the children of his predecessor.Isabel dos Santoss half-brother, Jos Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial for the attempted looting of $500m from the countrys sovereign wealth fund. He has pleaded not guilty. Her half-sister, Welwitschia dos Santos, a member of parliament, was impeached last year after moving to Britain. She fled after alleging she had been threatened by the Angolan secret service.Dos Santos, however, is fighting back. In recent weeks, she has toured media outlets giving interviews, saying her wealth is the result of hard work and business acumen. Her husband has opened an arbitration dispute in London against the state diamond company, and says he is involved in a second arbitration over Galp in the Netherlands.The Netherlands dispute centres on a loan from the state oil company, Sonangol, which sold part of its shareholding in Galp to a vehicle controlled by Dokolo in 2006. The agreed price was 75m, with Dokolos company making an upfront payment of 11.2m and committing to pay the rest at a later date from dividends. If the whole amount had not been repaid by 31 December 2017, in euros, Dokolos vehicle risked losing the shares.While Dos Santos was chair of Sonangol, it agreed to let Dokolos vehicle make the repayment in Angolas volatile currency, the kwanza. After Dos Santos was sacked from the state oil company, its new managers cancelled the deal and sent the money back. Sonangol is now demanding compensation.Dokolo denies the deal was a preferential one, and said there was absolutely no wrongdoing. Through his lawyers, he said that it had been approved after an internal review at Sonangol, and that the state oil companys purchase of a shareholding in Galp, one of its most successful investments, was originally his wifes idea and had been negotiated by him.Dokolo said he invested $115m in equity in the Swiss jeweller; that his commitment matched that of the state diamond company; and that the business steadily improved under his ownership.Dos Santos said under her leadership, Sonangol spent far less on consultants than previously. Her lawyers said the Dubai company that handled Sonangols payments to consultancy firms was a lead contractor with a formal contract approved by the board of directors, and was not owned by Dos Santos.Challenged about how she has apparently benefited from her fathers decrees, Dos Santos said the presidents role was to ratify government concessions and licences, and that it would be hard to do business in Angola without ever having a decree relating to one of her companies. Her lawyers added that the prices agreed with her companies for the proposed redevelopment of Luanda were competitive, and that the allegations of overcharging were false and unfounded.In a sign that the international community is beginning to close ranks against Dos Santos, her name has been removed from a list of participants preparing to meet in Davos this week for the World Economic Forums annual gathering of business and political leaders. Her company Unitel had paid to be a sponsor. The events organisers said they were re-evaluating Unitels participation.Additional reporting by Caelainn Barr.',\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Britains Prince Harry has spoken of his sadness at being forced to give up his royal duties in a deal with Queen Elizabeth and senior Windsors, saying there was no other option if he and his wife Meghan were to seek an independent future. Buckingham Palace and the queen announced on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of Britains monarchy, no longer use their Royal Highness titles and would now pay their own way in life, freeing them to forge what they call a progressive new role. The new arrangement was struck to end a crisis the couple sparked by announcing earlier this month they wanted to cut down on official engagements and spend more time in Canada and the United States, while remaining active royals. In a speech to the Sentebale charity on Sunday, a clearly upset Harry said the final outcome was not what he and his American wife, a former actress, had wanted. Our hope was to continue serving the queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations without public funding. Sadly that wasnt possible, the prince, the sixth-in-line to the throne, said. Ive accepted this knowing it doesnt change who I am, or how committed I am. But I hope that helps you understand what it had come to, that I would step back from all I have ever known to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful life. Under the arrangement, Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between Britain and North America, where they will spend the majority of their time. But they will not take part in any future ceremonial events or royal tours. Royal commentators said it amounted to an abdication from the firm - as the royals are known - and showed that, beneath the warm words in which she said Harry and Meghan were much loved, the queen had taken a decisive line by insisting on a clean break. It brings me great sadness that it has come to this, said Harry. He said the decision to step back had followed months of talks and had not been a decision he had come to lightly. They were not walking away, he explained.  As far as this goes, there really was no other option. He told the audience at the charity he co-founded to help children with HIV in Africa that he wanted them to hear the truth from him not as a prince, or a duke, but as Harry, the same person that many of you have watched grow up over the last 35 years but with a clearer perspective. The UK is my home and a place that I love. That will never change, he said.  The couples plans for independence, announced after a long break over the Christmas period in Canada, caught the rest of the royal family by surprise and left the queen and other senior members hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources. However, in a TV interview aired in October, both had made it clear how they were struggling with the immense media attention. The couple had also started legal action against a newspaper for printing a letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.  Harry said he felt his wife had faced bullying from some tabloids similar to that faced by his mother Princess Diana who died in a car crash while trying to escape paparazzi photographers. When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing. Youve looked out for me for so long but the media is a powerful force and my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful because this is so much bigger than just us, he said. Buckingham Palace have said the couple would no longer receive public money and that they would repay the cost of refurbishing their cottage in Windsor, which official figures show amounted to 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million). But certain details, such as their future security arrangements or whether the couple could continue to use the Sussex Royal title for their website and branding, have either not been finalised or publicly revealed.    Meghan is currently in Canada with their baby son Archie and Harry is expected to join her soon.  The royal crisis, which has dominated the British news agenda for almost two weeks, overshadowing Brexit and tensions over Iran, exposed a deep rift among the Windsors and poses questions about its role in the modern world. The Sun newspaper said Harry and his elder brother William, with whom he acknowledged he had fallen out, had ended their feud but he remained at loggerheads with his father Prince Charles, the heir-to-the-throne.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed the whole of Britain would want to wish the couple the very best. However, Meghans father was less generous, accusing them of damaging the monarchy. They are destroying it, they are cheapening it, theyre making it shabby, Markle told Britains Channel 5. Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Alison Williams',\n",

Many people have demanded they be moved.Osman Salih launched a Facebook campaign, Sudananimalrescue, and wrote: I was shaken when I saw these lions at the park ... Their bones are protruding from the skin.I urge interested people and institutions to help them.Park officials and vets said the lions conditions had deteriorated over the past few weeks. Some had lost almost two-thirds of their body weight.Food is not always available so often we buy it from our own money to feed them, said Essamelddine Hajjar, a manager at the park, which is managed by the Khartoum municipality but is partly funded by private donors.Sudan is in the middle of an economic crisis led by soaring food prices and a shortage of foreign currency.On Sunday residents, volunteers and journalists visited the park to see the lions after their photographs went viral on social media networks.One of the five cats was tied with a rope and was fed fluids through a drip as it recovered from dehydration, an AFP reporter who toured the park wrote. Chunks of rotten meat covered in flies lay scattered near the cages.The condition of the park was also affecting the animals health, another official at the park said.They are suffering from severe illnesses, a caretaker, Moataz Mahmoud, said.

The idea is to amend about 46 penal provisions to either remove criminality, or to restrict the punishment to only fine, or to allow rectification of defaults through alternative methods, which would help to de-clog the criminal justice system in the country. The intention now, is to extend this exercise to laws dealing with income tax and money laundering.I have gone through this (Companies Act) with a comb. We are working to decriminalise companies and ensure that no other Acts including Income Tax Act and PMLA, have such provisions,\" Sitharaman said in Chennai, The Indian Express reported. The ministers assurance of rationalising penalty provisions in Income Tax Act comes just over a week before she presents the union budget for FY21 in Parliament.The ministers assurance that the government was moving towards a direction where every businesses is not looked with suspicion, is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modis statement in his Independence Day speech last year that wealth creators should not be viewed with suspicion as wealth can be distributed only when it is created.Modi had said in his address to the nation on the 73rd Independence Day that wealth creation was a great national service and that they should not be seen with suspicion.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese security forces fired water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas on Sunday to try to break up stone-throwing protesters in Beirut, which has been rocked by some of the worst violence since unrest erupted in October. Sundays confrontation broke out near parliament a day after more than 370 people were wounded, the biggest casualty toll since the protests against the ruling elite began. Unrest in the capital this week has deepened the multi-faceted crisis sweeping Lebanon as it grapples with financial strains that have sunk the currency, pushed up prices and driven banks to impose capital controls. Politicians have failed to agree on a government or an economic rescue plan since the protests pushed Saad al-Hariri to quit as prime minister in October. We have gone from being a country we used to call the Switzerland of the east to a country ranked at the bottom in everything, said housewife Rezzan Barraj, 47, at Sunday nights protest. Its clear that the more they (security forces) step up their violence, the more peoples strength and determination grow.     A Reuters witness saw police fire rubber bullets. The Lebanese Red Cross said it treated 52 people and took 38 to hospital.  Hundreds of people yelled revolution in the commercial district of the capital. Protesters pelted riot police with stones and fireworks.  Some tried to climb over barbed wire and fencing to storm a heavily barricaded part of central Beirut that includes parliament. One man jabbed police with a pole across the barriers as the violence escalated. Zeina Ibrahim, 37, an office manager, said protesters had faced violence from police and attacks from supporters of the sectarian, dominant parties.  Violence only breeds violence, she said. After all this time, all these months...I dont blame protesters at all if they move bit by bit towards violence. The Internal Security Forces (ISF) urged people to remain calm and said otherwise it would be forced to repel them.

Human Rights Watch on Saturday called for an end to a culture of impunity for abuse by police, which it said fired tear gas canisters at some peoples heads.  Interior Minister Raya al-Hassan said people had the right to protest but it was unacceptable to blatantly assault security forces.  Protesters have also turned their anger on the banks - which have curbed access to savings - with some smashing the facade of the banking association on Saturday night.

       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - Foreign powers agreed at a summit in Berlin on Sunday to shore up a shaky truce in Libya, but the meeting was overshadowed by blockades of oilfields by forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar that could cripple the countrys crude production. Haftar, whose self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) is bearing down on the capital, Tripoli, with the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russian mercenaries and African troops, attended the one-day summit in the German capital despite having abandoned talks over a ceasefire last week. Turkey has rushed troops to Tripoli, as well as Turkish-backed fighters from Syria, to help Libyas internationally recognized government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj resist eastern commander Haftars assault. Although there has been a lull in air strikes and less fighting over the past 10 days, heavy exchanges of artillery fire could be heard from some front lines south of Tripoli late on Sunday, residents said. Libya has had no stable central authority since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed rebels in 2011. For more than five years, it has had two rival governments, in the east and the west, with streets controlled by armed groups. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters that the Berlin summit, attended by the main backers of the rival Libyan factions, had agreed that a tentative truce in Tripoli over the past week should be turned into a permanent ceasefire to allow a political process to take place. A special committee made up of five military officials from each side will monitor the truce, she said. Foreign powers active in Libya have committed themselves to uphold an existing U.N. arms embargo and stop shipping weapons there, she added. Serraj and Haftar did not meet in Berlin, Merkel said, highlighting the gulf between the two. We know that we have not solved all of Libyas problems today but we were aiming for fresh momentum, she said. Haftar, the easts most powerful figure, has won backing from a range of foreign allies for an assault to capture Tripoli in the west, while Turkish support for Tripolis effort to repel him has turned the conflict into a proxy war. More than 150,000 people have been displaced by the fighting for the capital. Haftar quit a Turkish-Russian summit a week ago and escalated the conflict on Friday when eastern oil ports were shut down. Libyas National Oil Corporation (NOC) said the shutdown was directly ordered by Haftars forces.  On Sunday, NOC said the major southwestern fields of El Sharara and El Feel were closing after forces loyal to Haftar shut a pipeline. The closures will cut Libyas oil output to 72,000 barrels a day (bpd) from 1.2 million bpd in just a few days time unless the blockages are lifted, the NOC said. Any lasting closure could hit Tripoli hard since the government relies on oil revenues to fund its budget.  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was very worried about the closure. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Serraj and Haftar had in general agreed to solve the output blockage, without giving a time frame. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that progress had been made towards reaching a full-fledged ceasefire in Libyas war, adding that he hoped Libyan oil facilities would reopen as a result of the talks. The east under Haftar has tried to export oil, bypassing the NOC, to gain a greater share of oil revenues. A call for a ceasefire from Russia and Turkey helped reduce fighting a week ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said ahead of a meeting with Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the conference. We dont lose hope that dialogue will continue and the conflict will be solved, Putin said.  Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio called the summit a point of departure for achieving a ceasefire and blocking a flow of arms into Libya that has accelerated with Haftars offensive. Italy, the former colonial power, has a particular interest in Libyan security as the main destination of hundreds of thousands of African migrants sent across the Mediterranean by smugglers until a sharp downturn in flows in 2017. But since the NATO bombing campaign that helped overthrow Gaddafi, Western countries have stepped back from playing a decisive role in Libya, allowing Russia, Turkey and Arab states to take the lead as outside powers with the most clout. Pompeo and European and Arab leaders attended the summit, and Haftars forces published pictures of him meeting Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash tweeted on Sunday night that the UAE supported efforts by the Berlin conference to seek a political solution to the crisis in Libya. Both Serraj and Haftar met Merkel on different occasions. Serraj could be also seen hugging Erdogan, while Macron and Haftar were both seen smiling in pictures when they met in a corridor.

The protest came only days after the European Commission unveiled ideas on how to finance its flagship Green Deal project that aims to make the European Union a CO2 emissions-neutral area by 2050, in part through the transformation of the car industry. A member and former spokesman for the group, Christophe Meierhans, said Extinction Rebellion targeted the car industry because it told a lot of lies in order to sell more cars.

       " 'KUWAIT (Reuters) - Qatar Airways, Emirates and several other Gulf airlines still fly in Iraqi and Iranian airspace and to cities in both countries, even as other international carriers have rerouted planes since the United States and Iran traded military strikes. Executives and analysts said carriers in the Gulf, a major transit stop between European and Asian destinations, have few alternative routes to choose from in an area where much of the airspace is kept clear of civilian aircraft for military use. In the latest flare up, a U.S. drone strike killed a top general in Iraq on Jan. 3 and Iran fired missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8. In the tense aftermath, Irans air defenses accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner. Gulf carriers have grown into major airlines even as regional tensions in recent decades erupted into conflict. Rerouting flights hurts profits, they say, although they also insist that they take every precaution to keep passengers safe. Iranian airspace is important for all carriers in this region, said Adil al-Ghaith, Emirates senior vice president, commercial operations, Gulf, Middle East and Iran. Dubai-based Emirates and sister carrier flydubai together serve 10 cities in Iran and Iraq, and have continued to use the airspace of both countries for other flights. Kuwait Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways have continued using Iranian and Iraqi airspace. We will continue to fly to Iran because Iran is an important country to us and it is our neighbor and we want to serve the people of Iran, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said on the sidelines of a Kuwait air show. Qatar has forged closer economic ties with Iran since 2017 when neighboring Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab states cut relations with Doha in a diplomatic row. The Qatari state carrier turned to Iranian airspace to keep its network that flies through its Doha hub operating. At the same time, many other international carriers have rerouted flights to avoid Iraq and Iran since the military strikes this month, including Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), Air France (AIRF.PA), Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and Qantas (QAN.AX). Some regional carriers have also changed their routes. Bahrains Gulf Air has redirected European flights away from Iraqi airspace and now flies longer, more fuel consuming routes over Saudi Arabia and Egypt. We want to take the safest option even if it costs us a little bit more for a period of time. We can live with that, Gulf Air Deputy Chief Executive Waleed Abdulhameed al-Alawi told Reuters. The UAE regulator told its carriers  Emirates, Etihad, flydubai and Air Arabia (AIRA.DU)  this month to evaluate flight path risks although it said it was up to the airlines to make the final decision on the routes they chose. Gulf carriers face a big challenge but that doesnt mean that risks can be taken - even if that inflicts damage on the business model, independent aviation consultant John Strickland said. Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752, bound for Kiev, was shot down in error after taking off from Tehran on Jan. 8, killing all 176 people aboard. Iran said on Saturday it was sending the black boxes to Ukraine. (This story was refiled to remove extraneous word in paragraph 13) Reporting by Alexander Cornwell; Editing by Edmund Blair',\n",

The report did not give a death toll.The disgraceful actions of the Houthi militia without a doubt confirm its unwillingness to (achieve) peace, because it knows nothing but death and destruction and is a cheap Iranian tool in the region, it quoted Hadi as saying.The Houthis did not make any immediate claim of responsibility.Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have been killed and millions displaced since 2015, when Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in the conflict to back the government against the Houthi rebels.The conflict, which the United Nations says has caused the worlds worst humanitarian crisis, has pushed the country to the brink of famine.',\n",

I feel the name is the first thing that starts limiting a human being to a certain religion or nationality. It was important for me to give a name that shouldnt link [my baby] to any religion.

The patent is filed under the US Patent No 20200019367 titled \"Cross-Device Interactions.\" In one of the descriptions, Apple explicitly mentions touchscreen laptops.It stated that \"in some embodiments, display 5012 is also a touch-sensitive display,\" moreover, it adds that \"in one or more of such embodiments, the user optionally performs a variety of finger inputs over display 5012 to enter user inputs via display 5012,\" AppleInsider reported recently.As seen in the patent description, the screen is described as \"a touch sensitive display\" and the user can choose \"a variety of finger inputs over display\" depending on their purpose. The touch display can be used for various functions and commands. Earlier, Craig Federighi the senior Vice President of Apple said the company has decided against producing a touchscreen Mac.\"We really feel that the ergonomics of using a Mac are that your hands are rested on a surface, and that lifting your arm up to poke a screen is a pretty fatiguing thing to do,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ve looked at any of the other guys to date and said, how fast can we get there?\"',\n",

       " ' All the six death warrants issued in 2019 by various courts across the country were eventually stayed or quashed by the Supreme Court or high courts, said an annual statistics report published on Friday by Project 39A at National Law University, Delhi.A death warrant sets a date for the hanging of a death row convict and is one of the final steps in the execution of a convict. It is usually issued after a convict has exhausted all legal remedies.Of the six death warrants issued in 2019, one was quashed by the Supreme Court on the grounds that all remedies available to the convict under the law had not been exhausted, the report said. Three other death warrants were stayed by the top court on the same grounds.Of the remaining two death warrants, one was quashed by the Bombay high court on the grounds that it was issued ex-parte. The Bombay high court also went on to commute the death sentence of both the convicts to life imprisonment.One death warrant was stayed by the Madras high court on the grounds that the death warrant was not served on the petitioner and that the right of the petitioner to file a mercy petition before the governor was still pending.The report came at a time when a death warrant issued against the 2012 Delhi gang-rape convicts has come under the scanner over purported violation of the law laid down by the Supreme Court and the Delhi prison manual, thereby casting a shadow on the efficacy of the process of sending a person to the gallows.A Delhi court on January 7 issued a death warrant against the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case, Mukesh, Akshay, Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta, and set January 22 as the date of their hanging. This warrant was issued despite the fact that two of the convicts, Akshay and Pawan, had not yet filed their curative petitions before the Supreme Court. Further, three of them have also not availed the right to file mercy petitions before the President.On January 17, the court issued a fresh death warrant resetting the date of hanging as February 1.Legal experts questioned the correctness of the death warrant, which they said cannot be issued before a convict exhausts all his legal remedies. The convicts can file mercy pleas before the President, which again must be decided before the death warrant can be executed, said senior advocate Rebecca John.This death warrant is in blatant violation of the Delhi prison manual which is explicit that the sessions court cannot issue a death warrant until the mercy plea is rejected. This also disregards the Supreme Court decisions in Shabnam vs Union of India and Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India, said Dr Anup Surendranath, assistant professor at National Law University, Delhi and executive director at Project 39A.The report by Project 39A also throws light on other aspects concerning death sentences. The proportion of cases involving sexual offences in which death sentence was imposed in 2019 was the highest in the last four years.Trial courts in the country imposed 102 death sentences in 2019. Of these, the proportion of cases involving sexual offences stood at 52.94% (54/102), the highest since 2016 when the university first started tracking death penalty cases.The report states the proportion of death sentences for sexual offences by sessions courts has been steadily increasing since 2016. It was 18% in 2016, 39.81% in 2017 and 41.35% in 2018.High courts in 2019 confirmed the highest number of death penalty cases (26 persons and 15 cases) in four years, with 65.38% of these cases involving sexual offences.The Supreme Court in 2019 pronounced the highest number of decisions (27) in death penalty cases since 2001, which the report says can be attributed to the listing priority given by former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to death penalty cases. The 27 cases in the Supreme Court involved six confirmations, 17 commutations, three acquittals and two being remanded for fresh trial.Ten people were acquitted of all charges in the three acquittals, where the Supreme Court highlighted the lackadaisical nature of investigation and mala fide prosecution. They had served a maximum of 13 years on death row.Of the 17 commutations, eight were eligible for remission after 14 years, three were sentenced to a fixed term of 25 years, two others for 30 years fixed term and four persons for imprisonment for natural life with no possible release.The report also pointed out a case in which the top court ordered a fresh trial on the grounds that a fast-track trial within 13 days meant that the accused had not received a fair trial.In two cases from 2012 and 2015, the Supreme Court invoked the policy considerations underlying the 2019 POCSO amendments to confirm the death sentence.There were 378 prisoners on death row in India as of December 31.',\n",
       " 'Cameras miles in the sky, a countdown and then boom: US President Donald Trump has recounted the final moments of Irans powerful General Qasem Soleimani in an American drone strike.Trump delivered the account Friday night to Republican Party donors gathered at his Florida residence Mar-a-Lago for a fundraising dinner, US media said.CNN on Saturday broadcast an audio recording in which the president gave new details about the January 3 strike at the airport in Baghdad. It killed the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force commander and members of Iraqs Hashed al-Shaabi, a paramilitary force with close ties to Iran.He was supposed to be invincible, Trump said.Democrats and other critics have questioned the timing of the strike, the month before Trumps Senate impeachment trial, and the administrations shifting reasons for launching it.In the audio released by CNN, Trump did not refer to an imminent attack which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Soleimani was planning. Nor was there a reference to four embassies which Trump later alleged were being targeted.He was saying bad things about our country. He was saying like, Were going to attack your country. Were going to kill your people. I said Look, how much of this shit do we have to listen to?, Trump told his guests.He then described the scene, relaying the words of the military officers giving live updates to him in Washington.They said, Sir, and this is from, you know, cameras that are miles in the sky. They are together sir. Sir, they have two minutes and 11 seconds. No bullshit. They have two minutes and 11 seconds to live, sir. Theyre in the car. Theyre in an armored vehicle going. Sir, they have approximately one minute to live, sir... 30 seconds, 10, nine, eight... then all of sudden boom. Theyre gone, sir.Trump acknowledged that the US strike shook up the world but said Soleimani deserved to be hit hard because he was responsible for killing thousands of Americans -- a figure which contrasted with one he gave on January 8. At that time, Trump said the Iranian wounded and murdered thousands of US troops.Iran vowed revenge for the US strike, raising fears of war, and later launched missiles at bases in Iraq housing US troops.

       " 'With a lineage of films that mostly include romantic dramas and commercial potboilers, one wont really expect Karan Johar to step on to uncharted grounds. Yet, he has done it time and again with films such as Dostana, My Name is Khan, Kalank or even his latest anthology, Ghost Stories. In a candid chat, Karan talks about why theres a constant need to step out of the comfort zone and how the web empowers writers that in turn empowers content in cinema, too.Youve directed as well as produced content on the web. Whats it about this space that you find to be most intriguing?For storytellers and content creators, its a Renaissance period. The digital space is just exploding, and tremendous content is coming out on various platforms. The web is empowering writers, and Im glad because we needed to be empowered. Web content is driven by writers, and the moment theyre empowered, theyre more motivated, and therefore, are writing even better feature films. So, this explosion digitally has also empowered content in cinema.Your production, Drive (2019), didnt fare well. Do you regret releasing it on an OTT platform?The initial plan was to release it theatrically, but then I realised the way the content has gone, it would be better for it to be on a digital format. And it was very brave of the OTT platform also to take the leap along with me. There are thousands of stories being told, so, sometimes you need to shake up and break the clutter with certain decisions. Thats what we did with a film like Drive. Im not speaking about the film because thats for people to judge.Your latest outing, GhostStories, is a genre that audience wouldnt relate to the brand Karan Johar. While directing it, how much did you personally connect with it?Horror and Idont connect at all, and very honestly, theyll not happen again. This is my first and only horror story that Ive made for Netflix. Its not a genre that I enjoy watching, so why should I enjoy making it?So, was it more of a challenge?Yes, because I felt like this gives me the ability to be out of my comfort zone and tell a story being uncomfortable. I think every filmmaker should be, at one point, uncomfortable to tell a story because that challenges their core directorial spirit. So, making this horror anthology has been the most challenging schedule in my 21-year-long journey.Why dont we see many anthology films releasing in a theatre?Its a format much attuned for the digital zone because we, in cinema, are very used to the syntax of storytelling  an escalated drama, a mid-point where you come out, chat about it and go back. Here, we have four narratives, four stories that start and stop one after the other that youre more likely to watch in your private space. Whats great about anthology is that it gets you to chat about each film and also you compare them with each other.',\n",

If you sell, you are taken into a film, if you dont then you are not taken. When Anurag announced this film Saand Ki Aankh, I called him and said Ye role to mai kar sakti hu, kya tum young ka kar rahe ho ya old ka kar rahe ho (I can do this role, are you tracing the younger part of their lives or the older one)?

If Badhaai Ho was not a hit, I wouldnt be called for all these roles. There is nothing emotional, it is a business. You do well, you sell well. Agar Badhaai Ho hit nahi hoti to mujhe ye sab nahi milta jo mil raha hai. Mere ko pucho, maine to sabse zyada old woman ke roles kiye hain jab mai jawan thi. In fact, ab mai apni umar se kam role kar rahi hu jab mai budhi hun (If Badhai Ho was not a hit, I wouldnt have gotten these roles. Ask me, I have done maximum roles of older women when I was young. In fact, I am essaying roles younger to me now). It is not like you are a director and you want somebody and you can take that somebody (in your film). It does not work like that, she said.She further explained that she did not mean to demean or belittle the work of young actors. What I had said had nothing to do with who should do what. What I had said was, oh, I wish. There are lot of roles for younger actors but very few (roles) for older actors. Because, you know the reason, old age me waise bhi aurat ka kya yogdan hai real life me, humari country me (As it is, how much contribution do old women have in our real life in our country)? So there are many more films with younger actresses doing younger roles. Maine aise hi bol diya ki I wish ye mere se kara lete budha ka role kyuki mai issi umar ki hu (I just expressed my wish that they would have cast me in the role of an old woman as I am of the same age).I didnt say ki unse kyu karaya, mai unki jagah hoti, mai bhi karti wo role. Kyu nahi karungi? (I did not question their casting, I would have also done these roles if I were in their place, why not?). If there is an interesting role and the filmmaker is asking me to do it, who am I to say?I just said I wish, maybe I should have said it in my heart only, not out in the open. But people made another thing out of it, the National film award winning actor added.She further asserted that she has also essayed characters older to her age. I have played old woman when I was 30, it all depends on what you have. Us waqt koi choice nahi thi, mujhe karna pada. Mai nahi karna chah rahi thi boodhi aurat ka role. Par mujhe karna pada kyuki koi kaam nahi tha (I did not have a choice, I didnt want to essay roles of older women but I had to because I had no work). Otherwise, you do not play older (characters). Sometimes you go from young to older. I am playing a very old womans role now also. But it is a fantastic role, and I will kill myself to do it.Talking about her upcoming film Panga and the films lead Kangana Ranaut, Neena said, With Kangana, I did not have many scenes but wherever, the one or two scenes that I have had, I find her real because she was as real as the role demanded her to be. She is very easy to work with and easy to get along, no problem. We had a nice time, gossiping and eating whenever we could. Directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, the film is slated to hit theatres on January 24.I have a very small part, footage wise. I play Kanganas mother. It is basically about the relationship between mother and daughter. Now that she wants to make a comeback and expects me to look after the kid as she makes a comeback. It is a typical mother-daughter relationship. But eventually, Panga is about how mothers are always there for you.Neena shared details of her most important scene and said, My most important scene is the last scene, where I say jab interview degi to sirf Prashant ka naam mat lena, apni mummy ka bhi lena. That was a very beautiful thing she had done. Earlier, I was supposed to be on the computer, typing and then I see her winning, her success stories. Then, she (Ashwiny) made me get up and walk till the door and uske baad chor diya mujhe jo karna hai karo (She just left it to me to do it the way I wanted). That is the beauty of it, ki ek rasta dikha ke chor diya (laughs). Usme agar laga ki nahi hua (If she was not satisfied with the result), then she would come in. Whatever I did it was very comfortable on sets.Praising Ashwiny for keeping the set calm, Neena said, Every day, when I shoot, I am learning. Now I am learning more because I have got more work to do. I learnt a lot from Ashwiny where she would know where I had gone a little sur higher? Sometimes, you do that because you cant have concentration for ten hours in a day. She would always catch it. She would tell me relax yourself, relax our shoulders, relax your head and go out and then do your thing. These are the little things you learn from everyday work. Thats what I learnt - relax and be as natural as possible.Even if it is a much small scene, you have to give it all. I cant think ki mera chota sa scene hai kar k nikal jau. I had to put in everything even if there was one scene. Chote role ka kya hota hai, graph nahi banta na zyada kyuki kam kaam hota hai. To us choti duniya me apko apna graph banana padta hai. Wo bahut mushkil hota hai. Agar apka bada sa role hai, lamba role hai to (footage wise aur waise bhi) to apka (character graph) ban jata hai ki yaha se waha gae fir ye kiya, fir ye hua fir wo hua. But isme, aap achanak gae, ek chota sa scene karke nikal aye (Small roles do not have graph due to limited screenspace. You need to build a graph in the limited space allotted to the character and I find that very difficult, she added.Asked if she would like to lead a more laidback life and retire from acting, Neena said, I will not retire, maybe I will work for 5 or 8 hours. Abhi to mai 15-15 ghante kaam kar rahi hun (I am working for 15 hours at a stretch right now). I am the happiest working, it is gives me the maximum pleasure. I have realized, not working for ten years, trying to be a housewife, whateverlooking after husband, children, acchi satisfaction nahi milti mujhe (It is alright, I did all of that but nothing gives me the satisfaction that my work does). Till my body and mind works, I will work. I am very happy when I work, this is my retirement. Talking about her future projects, Neena said, After Panga, I have Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhaaan releasing on February 21 in which I have a very substantial and interesting role. I have a film with Sanjay Mishra  Gwalior ; I have Netflix series Masaba Masaba; a series called Panchayat which might come on an OTT; Nikhil Advanis film with Rakul Preet Singh and Arjun Kapoor.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will no longer be working members of Britains monarchy and they will pay their own way in life as they embark on an independent future, Buckingham Palace said on Saturday. They will also no longer use their Royal Highness titles, the palace said in an announcement that sought to end turmoil in the monarchy sparked earlier this month when the couple announced they wanted to reduce their official duties and spend more time in North America. The queen and senior family members met last week to discuss the situation and have been in constructive and friendly discussions with officials on how this stepping back would work in practice for Harry, 35, and his American wife, former actress Meghan, 38. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family, Queen Elizabeth said in a statement issued by the palace, referring to the couples baby son. (Read the statement by Queen Elizabeth, here) I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life. The queen said she was particularly proud of how quickly Meghan had become one of the family. The couple married in May 2018 in a lavish ceremony at her home in Windsor Castle, west of London in front of a global TV audience of millions. Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between North America and Britain, but they will not take part in any future ceremonial events or royal tours.  Royal commentators said it amounted to an abdication from the royal family and showed that under the warm words, the queen had taken a firm and decisive line. It is harder to think of a much cleaner break than this. Harry and Meghan are still members of the Royal Family, but they are effectively no longer royal, the BBCs royal correspondent,  Jonny Dymond, said.  Meghan is currently in Canada with Archie and Harry is expected to join her soon. A palace spokeswoman said the couple would no longer receive public money and that they would repay the cost of refurbishing their cottage in Windsor, which official figures show amounted to 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million). It remained unclear what public funds would be spent on their security. Buckingham Palace declined to comment but said there was an independent process to determine public funding for security. The office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment on Saturdays news. The couples plans for independence, announced after a long break over the Christmas period in Canada, caught the rest of the royal family by surprise earlier this month and left the queen and other senior Windsors hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources. However, in a TV interview aired in October, both had made it clear how they were struggling with the immense media attention. Harry said he felt his wife had faced bullying from some tabloids.  A friend of Harry and Meghan also said last week the couple felt they had been driven out by some members of the royal family. The changes will come into effect in the spring of this year, the palace said, and there will be further royal engagements before the new arrangement is implemented, although it was not clear whether Meghan would be involved.  The situation will be reviewed in a years time by senior royals - the queen, Harrys father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and Harrys elder brother Prince William. There has been intense media speculation in recent days over what exact roles the couple would have. As agreed in this new arrangement they understand they are required to step back from royal duties, the Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said on Saturday. The Sussexes will not use their HRH title as they are no longer working members of the royal family. The change means Harry, who served a decade in the British Army, will give up his military patronages and his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.  It was not immediately clear whether the couple could continue to use the Sussex Royal title for their website and branding. While they will no longer receive public funding, Prince Charles will continue to offer private financial support, a royal source said. The source said the couple will spend the majority of their time in North America, and had not signed any commercial agreements as yet. Although they can no longer formally represent the queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of her majesty, the palace spokeswoman said. Before their wedding, Harrys spokesman said that Meghan was seeking to become a British citizen, but rules specify that prospective Britons spend the vast majority of their time in the United Kingdom. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the issue.  I think the queen has dealt with this crisis because she has absolutely drawn the line: you can be private people, but you cannot be royal at the same time, Alastair Bruce, a commentator on the royals, told Sky News.

       " 'Sanjay Singal, the Chairman and Managing Director of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL), allegedly  transferred money to shell companies under the guise of buying capital goods, then either routed the money back to BPSL as equity so as to borrow more money from banks or laundered it to buy property according to a charge sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate against him and 24 others by the Enforcement Directorate on Friday. Singhal  bought a house in one of the most expensive apartment buildings in the world,  One Hyde Park,  in Knightsbridge,  London worth Rs 162 crore and another in Delhis posh Jor Bagh for Rs 74 crore using laundered money, EDclaimed.EDs special prosecutor Nitesh Rana informed the court while filing the charge sheet that Sanjay Singal was  the mastermind behind diversion of loans taken from various banks by dressing up the books of accounts of BPSL. Singal and BPSL are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation and ED since July last year for allegedly diverting funds taken from banks. The company borrowed  Rs 47,204 crore between 2007 and 2014 from 33 banks.The charge sheet, a copy of which has been seen by HT,  said Singal diverted bank loans worth Rs 136.92 crore from BPSL to another entity controlled by him,  M/s Atma Ram House Investment Pvt Ltd (AHIPL) as an unsecured loan which he used to buy a house at 53,  Jor Bagh in 2011; he lives there with his family. Advocates Vijay Aggarwal and Mudit Jain, who appeared for Singal, declined comment. ED has not named his wife Aarti Singal in the chargesheet. She was earlier named as accused in the CBI FIR.Detailing how Singhal  acquired the London property, the ED charge sheet said: Not only in India, Sanjay Singal was also able to create assets in foreign countries by adopting the same modus operandi. Funds worth Rs 118 crore were diverted from BPSL either directly or through shell companies  to three companies controlled by him,  Aarti Iron and Power Private Ltd, Titanic Steel Industries Pvt Ltd and Vintage Steel Private Ltd, which in turn transferred these funds as equity infusion in a foreign company,  Aarti Steel Gulf FZCO.Aarti Steel again transferred these funds to another subsidiary,  Avantika Global Pvt Ltd as equity investment,  which used these funds towards acquisition of a residential apartment in one of the most posh locality of London (UK)  Apartment A.03.2 One Hyde Park  for an amount of GBP 2,02,04,433 (equivalent to Rs 162.344 crore at the then prevailing exchange rate, the charge sheet added. Residences at One Hyde Park are owned by members of royal families from Arab countries and the ultra rich from other parts of the world. In all, the agency said in its charge sheet that  it has established diversion of funds of around Rs 4,025 crore by Singal using different modus operandi . For example, he routed money  purportedly to buy  capital goods, whereas no actual movement of goods took place. The cash so generated was laundered. The ED charge sheet said that there was capital infusion of Rs 3,330.09 crore in BPSL between 2011-12 and 2016-17 by promoter companies,  Jasmine Steel Trading Ltd, Marsh Steel Trading Ltd, Diyajyoti Steel Ltd and Vision Steel Ltd, which received these funds from shell companies either as equity or debt.

       " 'New Delhi:At a time when international bowlers are worried about their workload, India\\'s Umesh Yadav lamented the lack of it, saying he is \"playing lesser and lesser\" in top-flight. In fact, one of India\\'s fastest bowlers is now eyeing a lengthy stint in county cricket in order to have more miles in his legs. A part of India\\'s fearsome pace quartet, Umesh does not feature in the white-ball set-up now, and wants a bit of clarity from selectors as to how his game time can increase.\"Workload management is a balance that you strike when you are constantly playing matches. In my case, it\\'s been the opposite. I have played lesser and lesser in the past two years (2018 and 2019). So there hasn\\'t even been optimum workload for me,\" Umesh said. He is in the city to play a Ranji Trophy game for Vidarbha.The man who has 142 wickets from 45 Tests feels that at his age, he needs to play more and more in order to stay in rhythm. \"I am 31 years old and the next four to five years are very important. If you look at my record. I played four Tests last year (2019) and before that another four in 2018. In white ball, I played only one game last year.\"At this age, the more I bowl, the better I will get. That\\'s why I am playing five first-class (one vs Saurashtra after this game) to have some more workload,\" said the man from Nagpur, who has 106 wickets from 75 ODIs.\"So in a World T20 year, after New Zealand tour, I have only IPL left and then no cricket. If I am not selected for white-ball cricket, I have precious little to do then,\" said Umesh, who took 23 wickets in 4 Tests in 2019 and has now played three Ranji Trophy games. So why didn\\'t he play county cricket when he is not in the white-ball scheme of things\"\"I got a county offer last season (from Gloucestershire). They wanted me to play seven games but the BCCI workload management policy doesn\\'t allow me to play more than two or three games. So the deal didn\\'t work out. Also I had some niggles to take care of after IPL.\"He would not mind playing county cricket this year as after New Zealand, India\\'s next Test assignment is in Australia at the end of the year.\"The concern about county cricket is that if they have a professional playing for them, they would hand over the ball to him and expect that bowler to send down maximum overs.\"When he plays Ranji Trophy, does he have any particular number of overs in mind, and he answered in the negative. \"I don\\'t think you can go into a game thinking about that you will bowl a stipulated number of overs. If my body permits and situation demands, I can bowl 25 overs in a day also,\" said the workhorse, who has toiled on the tough sub-continental pitches.',\n",
       " \"NEW DELHI :The Supreme Court on Friday sought response from the Centre on a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to implement the recommendations of National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020, and Niti Aayogs policy framework on 'zero emission vehicles for faster adoption of electric vehicles to mitigate the impact of climate change and air pollution.The bench comprising of Chief Justice SA Bobde, Justice BR Gavai and Justice Surya Kant have given the Centre a four-week deadline to file the response. The petition filed by Centre of Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), a non-governmental organization (NGO), was represented by senior advocate Prashant Bhushan.Bhushan argued that e-vehicles are more viable since the combustion process in compressed natural gas (CNG) enabled vehicles also causes global warming. A proper infrastructure for EV operated vehicles also needs to be developed, he added.Making EVs the first choice for buyers and replacing the conventional vehicles to eventually reduce liquid fuel consumption, compelled the NGO to file the petition.The plea further suggested ways including - preferential parking, exemption from toll fee, subsidised private ownership for charging infrastructure- in sync with international practices to boost the adoption of EVs.The lack of effort on the part of enforcement agencies and adequate laws have resulted into spiralling pollution levels and the air quality is steadily decreasing and no effective steps have been taken by the administration in this behalf, the petition said.\",\n",
       " 'Kharagpur: Researchers at IIT Kharagpur have evolved an Artificial Intelligence-aided method to automate the reading of legal case judgments, the premier institute said in a statement on Friday.The researchers from IIT Kharagpur\\'s Computer Science and Engineering department have developed two deep neural models to understand the rhetorical roles of sentences in a legal case judgment, which could prove phenomenal in India where AI is yet to sufficiently penetrate the legal field.The country uses a Common Law system that prioritises the doctrine of legal precedent over statutory law, and where legal documents are often written in an unstructured way.\"Taking 50 judgments from the Supreme Court of India, we segmented these by first labelling sentences with the help of three senior law students from IIT Kharagpur\\'s Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law, then performing extensive analysis of the human-assigned labels and developing a high quality gold standard corpus to train the machine to carry out the task,\" explained research lead Professor Saptarshi Ghosh.Unlike earlier attempts which required substantial human intervention, the neural methods used by Ghosh\\'s team enables automatic learning of the features, given sufficient amount of data, and can be used across multiple legal domains.This method can help in several downstream tasks such as summarisation of legal judgments, legal search, case law analysis, and other functions.In countries such as the US, Britain, Japan, Singapore and Australia, Artificial Intelligence is being used to perform legal research, review documents during litigation and conduct due diligence, analyse contracts to determine whether they meet pre-determined criteria, and to even predict case outcomes.Ghosh\\'s research scholar Paheli Bhattacharya is using network and text analysis to understand if two legal documents are similar. Among the other researchers are Kripabandhu Ghosh from the Tata Research Development and Design Centre, Pune, and Dr. Adam Wyner from Swansea University, UK. Shounak Paul is another research scholar associated with the project.\"We are trying to build an AI system which can give guidance to the common man about which laws are being violated in a given situation, or if there is merit in taking a particular situation to court, so that legal costs can be minimised,\" said Ghosh.A paper published on this research won the prestigious \\'Best Paper Award\\' at JURIX 2019, the International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, at Madrid.The project is being supported by the Science &amp; Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, under the project, \\'NYAYA: A Legal Assistance System for Legal Experts and the Common Man in India\\'.',\n",

While BCB was reluctant to play the Test series on Pakistan soil, it finally agreed on the tour given it was played under a split calendar. However, Bangladesh were dealt a massive blow with experienced player Mushfiqur Rahim pulling out of the tour citing security concerns. Rahim said that he has already informed the BCB that he wont be travelling to Pakistan for the tour as he said his family is concerned about the security conditions in Pakistan while adding cricket is not bigger than life.I have already informed Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) that I am not going to Pakistan for the upcoming series. I have submitted an official letter, and BCB accepted that. Not just T20Is, I am unavailable for the entire series, Mushfiqur told the media after the final of just-concluded Bangabandhu Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) final at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Friday.My family is afraid of the security condition of Pakistan. In this situation, I cant go to Pakistan and play cricket there. It is always tough for me to sit down from a series of Bangladesh national team, he added.The three-match T20I series between Pakistan and Bangladesh is scheduled to be played at a stretch between January 24 to 27, whereas the two-match Test series has been split between February and April. The first Test is scheduled to be played from February 7 in Rawalpindi and the second Test from April 5 in Karachi.In between the two-match Test series, a one-off ODI is scheduled on April 3  which makes the scheduling of the tour much more complicated.After the recently concluded Test series between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the Lankan players lauded the security arrangements in Pakistan as they said it is absolutely safe to play cricket in Pakistan. However, Rahim said that if the situation gets better in Pakistan and remains to be so consistently then he will love to visit there to play cricket. My family is not permitting me to go to Pakistan. Cricket is not bigger than life. But at the same time, I would like to say that the situation in Pakistan is better than before. I toured Pakistan in 2008 before that incident (terror attack on Sri Lankan team in 2009). Pakistan is a wonderful place to play cricket. The wickets of Pakistan are batting-friendly and I will miss playing there. But if the situation gets better and remains better consistently, I would definitely love to go to Pakistan to play cricket, Mushfiqur said.There are many players who did well in BPL and in India series. I will expect them to play well in the upcoming series as well. Its an opportunity for the young guys. Its really tough to play good cricket against a team like Pakistan in their home. But I believe the boys will pose a strong challenge, he added.',\n",
       " 'The newly-created department of military affairs (DMA), headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, will oversee key matters relating to Indias neighbouring countries including border disputes and incidents, development of infrastructure in forward areas and deployment of forces, according to new defence ministry order.These countries include China, Pakistan and Bhutan.Supply of arms and ammunition to friendly neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives will also come under the purview of the DMA, states the order published on Friday. It gives out details of work transferred from the ministrys department of defence (DoD) to the DMA.The new department is an addition to the four existing verticals in the defence ministry --- the departments of defence, defence production, defence research and development and ex-service welfare.The DMA will be staffed with two joint secretaries, 13 deputy secretaries, 25 under secretaries and 22 section officers.Monitoring developments in the Indian Ocean region, Afghanistan, West Asia and South East Asia will also be the responsibility of the DMA, according to the order. It clarified that notwithstanding the distribution of work, any matter that has an import on the defence policy will be dealt by the DoD, headed by the defence secretary.General Rawat, who took over as Indias first CDS on December 31, is the principal military adviser to the defence minister on all matters related to the tri-services.Issues related to counter-insurgency operations and Siachen glacier will be dealt by the DMA.Some of the other significant responsibilities assigned to the DMA include restructuring of the army, operational matters of the Indian Air Force, overseas deployment of warships, coastal security, revenue procurements and war wastage reserves (WWR) of the three services and.The armed forces are authorised to stockpile ammunition for a specified period of intense fighting, known as WWR in military parlance.Experts said the vast mandate of the DMA will bring about greater jointmanship in the military, accelerate decision making and avoid duplication of efforts. Jointmanship refers to a degree of co-ordination and integration in terms of strategy, capabilities and execution across the three services.Until now, the DoD was shouldering large responsibilities without having military officers in key positions. The DMA will foster better integration as it will be staffed with experts from the three services and also bureaucrats, said Lieutenant General Satish Dua (retd), a leading expert on tri-services matters.The secretariat of the defence acquisition council (DAC), the ministrys apex capital procurement body, will function under the DoD. The secretariat for DAC presently under the HQs Integrated Defence Staff will be shifted to the Director General, Acquisition Wing of DoD, the order reads.The DMA will, however, deal with procurement of air-to-air missiles and air-to-air guided weapons. It will also oversee the postings of senior officers (two-stars and above), matters relating to Indias military attaches posted abroad and humanitarian aid to foreign countries.The DMA will work towards promoting the use of indigenous equipment by the services at a time when the armed forces are heavily dependent on imported military hardware.The government expects the CDS to bring about jointness among the three services within three years. One of the key objectives behind jointmanship is the setting up of joint/theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles. While the army and the navy have been open to the idea, the IAF has concerns about theaterisation.The appointment of a CDS was one of the most significant recommendations made by the K Subrahmanyam-led Kargil Review Committee (KRC) that was constituted in the immediate aftermath of the 1999 Kargil war to examine lapses that allowed Pakistani soldiers to occupy strategic heights, the initial sluggish Indian response, and suggest measures to strengthen national security.',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - The United States will begin screening efforts at three U.S. airports to detect travelers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan who may have symptoms of a new respiratory virus that so far has killed two people and infected 45 more, public health officials said on Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports would begin on Friday and focus on travelers to the United States via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan. So far, the new virus has spread outside of China to Japan and Thailand, and CDC officials said in a conference call with reporters that they expect more cases will be reported outside of China. The risk to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDCs Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said the CDC will be sending about 100 additional staff to the three airports  Los Angeles International, San Francisco International and New Yorks John F. Kennedy International  to supplement existing staff at quarantine stations located at those airports. Under the screening procedures, travelers from Wuhan will be taken to a separate area in the airport, where they will complete a questionnaire and be checked for fever. Those with symptoms will be asked additional health- and exposure-related questions, and those needing more follow-up will be referred to a designated healthcare facility for more testing. The CDC said it may adjust screening procedures as the outbreak investigation continues. The Chinese virus is a coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a highly infectious virus that originated in China in 2002 and eventually traveled to 37 countries, killing 774 people.  So far, health officials do not consider the new virus from China to be as lethal as SARS, but the investigation is evolving and much is still not known about whether the virus can spread easily from person to person. This is the stage of the investigation where we need to proceed cautiously and be prepared for any eventuality, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a CDC expert in respiratory diseases, said on the conference call. Its highly plausible that there will be a case in the United States, Messonnier said. That is why we are moving forward with this screening. China health officials report that most of the patients infected with the virus have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting the virus is new and has jumped from animals to humans.  It is still not clear how well the virus can be transmitted, but there are indications of some limited spread from person-to-person, CDC officials said. The World Health Organization this week provided guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but antivirals are being considered. Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler',\n",
       " 'A counter-terrorism police document distributed to medical staff and teachers as part of anti-extremism briefings included Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups as well as neo-Nazis, the Guardian has learned.The guide, produced by Counter Terrorism Policing, is used across England as part of training for Prevent, the anti-radicalisation scheme designed to catch those at risk of committing terrorist violence.Last week, police said documents uncovered by the Guardian that listed the environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion (XR) alongside far-right extremists and jihadists were a local error.But the list of groups viewed as a potential concern contained in the new 24-page document includes Extinction Rebellion. It also includes Greenpeace  among whose supporters are Dame Judi Dench, Stephen Fry, Gillian Anderson and Joanna Lumley  and the ocean pollution campaigners Sea Shepherd, whose supporters include Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. Also included is Stop the Badger Cull, which is backed by Sir Brian May, the Queen guitarist.They appear alongside a number of extremist rightwing groups including Combat 18 and the National Front, as well as National Action, which has been banned for terrorist violence. The last page of an accompanying visual guide seen by the Guardian advises people to report any concerns identified via this document using an online portal for reporting suspicious activity that is operated by Counter Terrorism Policing under the slogan: Action counters terrorism.Police insist the guide is not meant to portray all the groups that it features as extremist and thus needing to be reported to them. They said it is meant to boost understanding of the signs and symbols people may come across, and point to a statement in the document that not all of the signs and symbols noted within this document are of counter terrorism interest.However, on the visual guide the disclaimer appears to refer specifically to a set of religious and historical symbols used by white supremacists including Odins Rune, SS Runes and Thors Hammer. Mainstream leftwing and environmental groups are not similarly marked.Non-violent groups featured in the document were furious at their inclusion. Tarring environmental campaigners and terrorist organisations with the same brush is not going to help fight terrorism, said John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK. It will only harm the reputation of hard-working police officers  How can we possibly teach children about the devastation caused by the climate emergency while at the same implying that those trying to stop it are extremists?Petas director, Elisa Allen, said: This appears to be a sinister attempt to quash legitimate campaigning organisations  something that is as dangerous as it is undemocratic.A spokesman for Extinction Rebellion said: The guidance document makes it clear that not all the signs and symbols are of counter-terrorism interest. However, if thats the case, why include them in a counter-terrorism document?Politicians were also critical of the document, with Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy called the inclusion of peaceful climate crisis groups absolute nonsense.Among the groups listed with no known link to terrorist violence or known threat to national security are Stop the War, the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, vegan activists, anti-fascist groups, anti-racist groups, an anti-police surveillance group and campaigners against airport expansion. Communist and socialist political parties are also on the list.They feature alongside numerous groups associated with the ideology of violence of the far right, and the terrorist group National Action, which is proscribed, as well as two other banned groups. There are also a set of symbols and tattoos commonly associated with white supremacy, from a swastika and a white pride worldwide poster to tattoos of an iron eagle and the second world war German general Erwin Rommel.The guide, from June 2019, bears the logo of Counter Terrorism Policing on every page, and was presented in briefings to public sector workers.One senior teacher, who supports the efforts to thwart radicalisation, said they received the document as part of Prevent training at their educational establishment: The document was given with the guidance that teaching staff could use it to identify symbols that students might draw or have about them and to enable staff to make a decision about whether it is a Prevent concern or not.The document is extraordinarily vague and leaves a great deal down to the interpretation of the individual member of staff, the teacher added. Clustering relatively innocuous groups like Greenpeace and CND in with genuine extremist groups seems to imply that these organisations are on the radar of the counter-terrorism police and should also be interpreted as such by the teaching staff coming across them.Police said it was unhelpful and misleading to suggest non-violent groups in the document were being smeared. They said it would be provided to Prevent partners as a guide to help them identify and understand the range of organisations they might come across and should not be viewed as suggesting that membership of non-proscribed groups would be sufficient to trigger a Prevent referral.Our focus is definitely not on lawful protest, or legitimate causes taken up by activists across the country, Counter Terrorism Policings senior national coordinator, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon told the Guardian.Dated June last year, the document was sent to doctors, schools and safeguarding children boards as a resource for practitioners of Prevent.A spokesman for Worcestershire Acute NHS Trust said the documents were available for staff to access as part of Prevent awareness. The documents were supplied to the trusts safeguarding and Prevent lead. It is also in use in the West Midlands.Last week, police claimed it was an error for a guide explicitly about extremism to include Extinction Rebellion alongside terrorist-supporting Islamist and extreme rightwing groups. They further said such an approach in the guide meant for police, teachers and other public sector workers was limited to the south-east of England. After the Guardian revealed the guides existence it was recalled.Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said the latest document was evidence that peaceful protest was under threat. We have long warned that the governments counter-terror agenda is one of the greatest threats to free speech in the UK. If you are passionate about anything from climate change to social justice or fighting racism in the UK today you risk being labelled extremist and your details being passed to the police.The UKs counter-terror measures are designed to co-opt public sector workers like teachers to spy on young people in their care  this guide will only add to the confusion and pressures they face. It also reinforces long held concerns that the governments staggeringly broad definition of extremism gives the police cover to characterise non-violent political activity as a threat, and monitor and control any community they wish.Additional reporting by Russell Scott',\n",
       " 'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday urged Iran to hand over black boxes from last weeks downed airliner to France, saying it has one of the few laboratories capable of properly examining them.Iran does not have the level of technical expertise and mostly the equipment necessary to be able to analyze these damaged black boxes quickly, Trudeau said.So, he told a press conference, the right place to send those black boxes to get proper information from them and in a rapid way is France, adding that is what were encouraging the Iranian authorities to agree to.There are only a few places, like France, that have laboratories that can do it, the prime minister explained. France has offered its services and there is a beginning of a consensus to send the significantly damaged flight data and cockpit recorders from the downed Ukrainian airliner there, he said.Earlier, Ukraines foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said Iran was ready to hand over the black boxes to his country.Prystaiko said Tehran would grant a team of investigators from Iran and Canada -- as the countries that lost the most nationals -- access to the recorders.After that, the Iranian side is ready to separately transfer the black boxes to Ukraine, he said.Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed last week shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people onboard. Ottawa has said 57 of the passengers were Canadian citizens. Trudeau said Friday another 29 were permanent residents and that Canada was the final destination for 138 of the 176 passengers and crew on the Kiev-bound plane, including visitors and students.After initial denials, Iran admitted it shot down the plane unintentionally while on high alert after firing missiles at US troops stationed in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.In Ottawa, Trudeau also pledged interim funds for families of the Canadian victims of the crash, but said he ultimately expects Iran to pony up full compensation.He said his government would provide Can$25,000 (US$19,000) to each family of the Canadian victims -- both citizens and permanent residents -- to assist with funeral arrangements, travel to Iran and other costs.I want to be clear: we expect Iran to compensate these families, Trudeau said.But, he added, I have met them and they cant wait weeks. They need support now.No Canadian remains so far recovered from the crash have been repatriated. Trudeau said he expects the first to arrive in Canada in the coming days.Meanwhile in Oman, Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had his first face-to-face meeting with Irans foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. According to a readout, Champagne pressed his counterpart to heed calls for a thorough and transparent investigation of the crash, and full access for Canadian officials to provide consular services and assist in victim identification.Canada severed diplomatic ties and shuttered its embassy in Tehran in 2012.amc/jh',\n",
       " 'Besides counting steps and how much you have slept, the Fitbit on your writs can also tell you if you are coming down with a flu and help you prepare for the outbreak. A study done in the United States used heart rate and sleep data from Fitbit to predict and therefore alert public health officials about real-time outbreaks of flu more accurately than the current surveillance methods. The study used data from more than 47,000 Fitbit users  from five US states. The results, that were published in The Lancet Digital Health journal, showed that by using Fitbit data, state-wide predictions of flu outbreaks were improved and accelerated.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that as many as 650,000 people worldwide die of respiratory diseases linked to seasonal flu each year.Traditional surveillance reporting  to detect and combat a flu outbreak takes up to three weeks, including response measures - such as deploying vaccines or anti-virals and advising patients to stay at home and can often lag.Responding more quickly to influenza outbreaks can prevent further spread and infection, and we were curious to see if sensor data could improve real-time surveillance, said Jennifer Radin, who co-led that study at the US Scripps Research Translational Institute.Previous studies using crowd-sourced data like Google Flu Trends and Twitter - have witnessed variable success, partly, experts say, because it is impossible to separate behaviour of people who are actually suffering from flu from those who search online about it, especially during outbreaks. For this study, Radins team de-identified data from 200,000 people whose Fitbits tracked activity, heart rate and sleep for at least 60 days during the March 2016 to March 2018 study period. From the 200,000 people, 47,248 users from California, Texas, New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania wore a Fitbit consistently during the period. The average age of these Fitbit wearers was 43 and 60% were female.The users resting heart rate and sleep duration were monitored and flagged as abnormal if the average weekly heart rate was significantly above their overall average and their weekly average sleep was not below their overall average.This data was then compared to the US Centers for Disease Controls weekly estimates for flu-like illness.Rosalind Eggo, a public health expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that the study suggests fitness trackers hold some promise as a disease surveillance tool.But she said more work is needed to gauge how reliable these data are over time, how specific these measurements are for flu, and how representative Fitbit users are of the whole population.',\n",
       " 'The Telangana police on Saturday arrested Chintakindi Kasim (43), a professor of Telugu in Osmania University in Hyderabad, on the charges of having links with outlawed CPI (Maoist) and propagating Maoist ideology in urban areas.A group of policemen in plainclothes, including those from special intelligence bureau (SIB), an anti-Naxalite special police wing, assisted by Siddipet police swooped on the residence of Kasim in the university staff quarters on the OU campus in the early hours and conducted searches for over four hours before taking him into custody. He was booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.We seized his mobile phones, pen drives, revolutionary literature and some incriminating material including the correspondence between Kasim and top Maoist leaders, a police official said on condition of anonymity.Later, the police took Kasim to an undisclosed location for questioning. We shall produce him in the court after conducting the mandatory medical tests, the police official said.Kasims wife Snehalatha told reporters that the Gajwel police in Siddipet district had implicated him in a false case way back in 2016 and arrested him now. She alleged that the police had broken open the front doors of the official quarters to enter the house for conducting searches.They took away some books and hard discs. They have foisted false cases against Kasim only because he has been questioning the anti-democratic functioning of the state government. I shall move the high court against this illegal detention of Kasim, she said.Kasim, who is a popular revolutionary poet and also edits a Telugu magazine Nadusthunna Telangana, was recently elected as secretary of Viplava Rachayitala Sangham (Virasam) or Revolutionary Writers Association, supposed to be the literary wing of the Maoist party.A close associate of revolutionary poet P Varavara Rao, who has been in Pune jail in connection with Bhima Koregaon violence case for over a year, Kasim has been an open supporter of the Maoist ideology. He has wider connections with top Maoist leaders including those in the central committee of the banned organisation. He has been spreading the Maoist ideology among the students and other sections, the police official said.The police said there had been a sedition case pending against Kasim in Mulugu police station on the charge that he had been working as a courier for Maoists. Meanwhile, tension prevailed on the OU campus with a large number of students thronging Kasims residence. They took out a rally and raised slogans against the government and the police.The Osmania University police arrived on the spot and dispersed the students. They took some of the protesting students into custody and let them off later.Communist Party of India leader K Narayana condemned the arrest of Kasim and said the Telangana government was harassing democrats and poets on the pretext of having Maoist connections.

       " \"The Trump administration took further steps on Friday towards rolling back healthier standards for school lunches in America championed by Michelle Obama, proposing rules to allow more pizza, meat and potatoes over fresh vegetables, fruits and whole grains.The new proposals would allow schools more flexibility, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in a statement, adding: Because they know their children best.Brandon Lipps, a USDA deputy under secretary, outlined new menu standards drawn up by the the Food and Nutrition Service agency. They would allow schools to cut the amount of vegetables and fruits required at school lunch and breakfasts while giving them greater scope to sell more pizza, hamburgers and french fries to students. The agency is responsible for administering nutritional programs that feed nearly 30 million students at 99,000 schools, the Washington Post reported.Some outlets noted the irony of the new proposals being announced on former first lady Michelle Obamas birthday.#BREAKING: Trump administration announces plans to roll back Michelle Obama's school lunch rules on her birthday https://t.co/a5jAcJYx3a pic.twitter.com/oPgj0nySZzSome school districts and food lobbies, such as the potato industry, have long sought to weaken standards put in place under the Obama administration that mandated more wholegrain foods, fruit and vegetables in school meals.The Trump admin has moved to roll back school nutrition standards championed by Michelle Obama, an effort long sought by food manufacturers and some school districts. The proposed rule came on Mrs. Obama's birthday. https://t.co/yCWJOjAoXgColin Schwartz, deputy director of legislative affairs for Center for Science in the Public Interest, told the Post that the latest proposed rules, if finalized, would create a huge loophole in school nutrition guidelines, paving the way for children to choose pizza, burgers, french fries and other foods high in calories, saturated fat or sodium in place of balanced school meals every day.In 2017 the agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, began taking action to roll back the healthier school meal standards promoted by Obama, in a move away from items such as wholegrain bread or brown rice and towards more sugar and white bread. He claimed children were not favoring the healthier choices.If kids arent eating the food, and its ending up in the trash, they arent getting any nutrition  thus undermining the intent of the program, he said at the time.\",\n",
       " 'Historian Ramachandra Guha said on Saturday his comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress Rahul Gandhi were just a part of his long talk at a literature festival in Kerala.The 61-year-old author had said people in Kerala had done a disastrous thing by electing a fifth-generation dynast Rahul Gandhi to Parliament as compared the Congress leader against the hard-working and self-made Prime Minister.After making the comments during his talk, Patriotism vs Jingoism at the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF), Guha sent out several tweets to issue a clarification.I did say in my #KLF talk that Rahul Gandhi was a fifth generation dynast, but I said much, much, more he tweeted along with the text on which his talk was based.Watch: Ramachandra Guhas fifth generation dynast jibe at Rahul GandhiMy talk was a defence of constitutional patriotism against Hindutva jingoism. I am sorry that a reporter has cherry picked two sentences out of a one hour talk to distort its meaning (sic), he wrote.He had talked about the differences between the former Congress president and the Prime Minister, as well as, listed some of Modis qualities.Narendra Modis great advantage is that he is not Rahul Gandhi. He is self-made. He has run a state for 15 years, he has administrative experience, he is incredibly hard-working and he never takes holidays in Europe. Believe me, I am saying all this in all seriousness, he had said, according to news agency PTI.Guha also said that even if Gandhi was much more intelligent, more hard-working, never took a holiday in Europe, as a fifth-generation dynast he still will be at a disadvantage against a self-made person. Guha has been critical of Modi in the past and even called him a man with dictatorial qualities. Last month, he had also accused the Modi government of using CAAwhich offers citizenship to undocumented migrants of multiple faiths other than Islam, from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistanto divert attention from a sinking economy.The historian said he stood by his comments on the Congress party and the rise of Hindutva in the country.That said, I do believe that the countrywide movement against Hindutva is handicapped by the fact that the party of the freedom movement is so closely controlled by a single family, Guha also tweeted.I ended my KLF talk by saying that even if the Congress may not be up to the task, ordinary citizens will carry on the struggle in defence of constitutional values. As they have done so admirably in the protests against the CAA.',\n",

       " 'Chinas per capita gross domestic product (GDP) crossed $10,000 for the first time in 2019 and it could become a high-income economy by 2023 or 2024. The Chinese economy grew at 6.1% in 2019, its lowest GDP growth in 29 years. Yet, Chinas importance in the global economy cannot be overemphasised. The Chinese economy accounts for almost 30% of the global GDP growth today. Both in terms of per capita GDP and global contribution to growth, China is now far ahead of India, although the gap has been plateauing in the recent years. (See chart 1: Ratio of China and India per capita GDP and GDP).Chinas per capita GDP reached $10,276 in 2019, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. This is the first time Chinas per capita GDP has crossed the $10,000 level. The 2018 per capita GDP figure was $9,771, which gives a simple annual growth of 5.2% between 2018 and 2019. A back of the envelope calculation shows that if this growth rate continues, China could become a high income economy  per capita Gross National Income of $12,376 or more  by 2023-24. So, by the time India becomes a $5 trillion economy, China could become a high income country. The achievement has come in a year when the worlds second largest economy grew at 6.1%, the lowest in 29 years. Chinas GDP numbers were released a day after US and China, the top two economies in the world, agreed to a trade deal, putting an end to 18 months of trade war including tariff and non-tariff measures. To be sure, the $10,000 per capita GDP barrier does not have a lot of significance. According to the World Bank classification for fiscal year 2020, low-income economies are defined as those with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more. So, China will continue to be in the upper-middle income country classification. Of the 218 countries for which income group data was available, according to a June 2019 World Bank classification, 80 countries were in the high-income category, while 60, 47 and 31 countries were in the upper-middle income, lower-middle income and low income category. South Asia, which also includes India, is the only region which does not have a high-income country. India is in the lower-middle income category with a per capita GNI of $2,079 in 2018. While China crossing the $10,000 per capita GDP barrier might not sound like a big development in the descriptive stats on income-wise distribution of countries discussed above, its a significant development given the size of the Chinese economy. Between 2010 and 2018, the latest period for which GDP data is available in the World Development Indicators database of the World Bank, China accounted for 29% of the total increase in world GDP in constant US dollars. This is 10 percentage points more than USs share in incremental global GDP during this period. For India, the number is 7.5%. Chinas share in world GDP in 2018 was 13%. (See Chart 2: Share in incremental global GDP)Chinas GDP growth will not come back to its earlier double digit levels, but as the first billion plus people economy to cross $10,000 per capita income level, its importance in the global economy will only increase in the future.

Vinesh downed two tough Chinese rivals on her way to the 53kg gold medal bout in which she overpowered Ecudors Luisa Elizabeth Valverde 4-0. Showing immense upper body strength, Vinesh had rattled her rival with shoulder pulls, never allowing her to attack.     She won by technical superiority against Khrystyna Bereza (10-0) and Lannuan Luo (15-5) before getting the better of Qianyu Pang (4-2).    If the win against Ukrainian Bereza was about spectacular double leg attacks, the quarterfinal win over the Luo was much tougher than the what the score-line suggested.Luo was a strong opponent, who led 5-2 at the end of first period but Vinesh turned it around with smart point-scoring moves from nowhere in the second period. Twice she threw Luo with moves from between the legs when the Chinese was holding her from the back.    With two wrestlers, having immense upper-body strength, jostling for upper hand from standing position was a sight to watch. Fighting a measured bout against Pang, Vinesh was in control in the semi-final, With two takedowns in each period she led 4-0 and conceded points only towards the end of the fight.      Vinesh will now fight for her first gold of the season with Ecuadors Luisa Elizabeth Valverde Melemdres.     The 18-year-old Anshu carried her sparkling form from the trials at her maiden international tournament at the senior level but could not replicate it in the gold medal bout, losing to Nigerias Odunayo Adekuoroye.

       " 'Washington:Instead of habitats made of metal and glass, NASA is exploring technologies that could grow structures out of fungi to become our future homes in the stars, and perhaps lead to more sustainable ways of living on Earth as well. Creating a livable home for future astronauts means doing more than growing a roof to go over their heads.Astronauts will need to have all their basic needs met, just like on Earth, and face the additional challenges of living in a harsh environment on a distant world, the US space agency said in a statement.Keeping that in mind, the myco-architecture project out of NASA\\'s Ames Research Center in California is prototyping technologies that could \"grow\" habitats on the Moon, Mars and beyond out of life - specifically, fungi and the unseen underground threads that make up the main part of the fungus, known as mycelia.\"Right now, traditional habitat designs for Mars are like a turtle - carrying our homes with us on our backs - a reliable plan, but with huge energy costs,\" said Lynn Rothschild, the principal investigator on the early-stage project.\"Instead, we can harness mycelia (vegetative part of a fungus) to grow these habitats ourselves when we get there\". Ultimately, the project envisions a future where human explorers can bring a compact habitat built out of a lightweight material with dormant fungi that will last on long journeys to places like Mars.Upon arrival, by unfolding that basic structure and simply adding water, the fungi will be able to grow around that framework into a fully functional human habitat - all while being safely contained within the habitat to avoid contaminating the Martian environment.Mycelia are tiny threads that build complex structures with extreme precision, networking out into larger structures like mushrooms. With the right conditions, they can be coaxed into making new structures - ranging from a material similar to leather to the building blocks for a Mars habitat.That last layer of mycelia is what organically grows into a sturdy home, first activated to grow in a contained environment and then baked to kill the lifeforms - providing structural integrity and ensuring no life contaminates Mars and any microbial life that\\'s already there.Even if some mycelia somehow escaped, they will be genetically altered to be incapable of surviving outside the habitat, said NASA.Mycelia could also be used for water filtration and biomining systems that can extract minerals from wastewater - another project active in Rothschild\\'s lab - as well as bioluminescent lighting, humidity regulation and even self-generating habitats capable of healing themselves. And with about 40% of carbon emissions on Earth coming from construction, there\\'s an ever-increasing need for sustainable and affordable housing here as well.The harsh environments of the Moon and Mars will require new ways of living - growing homes instead of building them, mining minerals from sewage instead of rock.\"But by turning to the elegant systems of our own natural world, we can design solutions that are green and sustainable. Whether on distant worlds or our own ever-changing Earth, fungi could be what brings us boldly into the future,\" said NASA.',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump turned to some legal heavyweights to help defend him in his Senate impeachment trial with the addition on Friday of former independent counsel Ken Starr, who paved the way for former President Bill Clintons 1998 impeachment, and prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz. The team defending the Republican president will be led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump private attorney Jay Sekulow, the White House said.  Trump adviser and former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi and former independent counsel Robert Ray will also be on the team, according to the source familiar with the teams composition. The White House also said Jane Raskin, one of Trumps private lawyers, and Eric Herschmann, another former independent counsel, would be on the presidents legal team. The trial in the Republican-led Senate formally got underway on Thursday, though it will start in earnest on Tuesday with opening statements. The trial will determine whether Trump is removed from office. The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted on Dec. 18 to impeach Trump on two charges arising from his dealings with Ukraine - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress - after an investigation that centered on his request that Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden, the presidents possible Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election. The Senate is expected to acquit him, as none of its 53 Republicans has voiced support for removing him, a step that requires a two-thirds majority. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the impeachment process a sham. Starr is a former federal judge who held a senior Justice Department post under Republican President George H.W. Bush. Starrs voluminous investigative report on Clintons sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky served as the basis for his impeachment in the House on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate in 1999 acquitted Clinton, a Democrat. Starr had recommended impeachment on 11 grounds. In 2016, Starr was ousted as president of Baylor University, a private Baptist institution in Texas, after an investigation by an outside law firm determined that university leaders had mishandled accusations of sexual assault by football players. Critics of Starr at the time accused him of turning a blind eye to sexual violence on his campus after pursuing Clinton for a sexual relationship. Both Starr and Dershowitz also served as lawyers for financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his New York jail cell last year where he was being held on new sex trafficking charges. In 1999, Trump made unflattering comments about Starr, saying in an interview on NBCs Today show after Clintons acquittal: I think Ken Starrs a lunatic. In a 1999 interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Trump said, Starrs a freak. I bet hes got something in his closet. Dershowitz has been a well-known figure in U.S. legal circles for decades. He was a long-time Harvard Law School professor and was part of the so-called Dream Team of lawyers who won a 1995 acquittal of former National Football League star and actor O.J. Simpson on charges of murdering his wife and a friend of hers. Dershowitzs past clients also have included boxer Mike Tyson and televangelist Jim Bakker. Both Starr and Dershowitz were defenders of Trump in media interviews during the impeachment process. Sources working with the Trump legal team said the president wanted Dershowitz because of his background as a constitutional scholar.  A statement provided by Dershowitz from Trumps legal team said he will present oral arguments at the trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal from office.  While Professor Dershowitz is non-partisan when it comes to the constitution - he opposed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton - he believes the issues at stake go to the heart of our enduring Constitution, the statement said. Ray succeeded Starr as independent counsel during the Clinton investigation. On the day before Clinton left office, Ray announced that he would not criminally prosecute him in connection with perjury and obstruction. One person who was not added to the team that will defend Trump at the trial is his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who played a key role in the Ukraine matter. Democrat Adam Schiff heads a team of seven House members who will serve as prosecutors. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. Still to be determined is whether the Senate will allow witness testimony and new evidence or whether senators will decide the case as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has suggested using only the material amassed by House investigators. Trump involved the national collegiate champion Louisiana State University football team in the impeachment drama during its celebratory visit to the White House. A lot of presidents, some good, some not so good, Trump told the team. But youve got a good one now, even though theyre trying to impeach the son of a bitch. Can you believe that? Citing themes he has raised in his bid to win re-election on Nov. 3, Trump then touted the economy and the U.S. military, adding, We took out those terrorists like your football team would have taken out those terrorists, right? A pivotal event in the Ukraine matter was Trumps firing of Marie Yovanovitch last year as U.S. ambassador in Kiev, a move encouraged by Giuliani, who was pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke his silence on Friday on documents released this week that suggested that Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate, was involved in monitoring Yovanovitchs movements before Trump removed her, raising questions about her security. We will do everything we need to do to evaluate whether there was something that took place there, Pompeo, who refused to cooperate in the House impeachment inquiry, told conservative radio host Tony Katz.  I suspect that much of whats been reported will ultimately prove wrong, but our obligation, my obligation as secretary of state, is to make sure that we evaluate, investigate, Pompeo said.

       " 'Australia batsman Steve Smith rued the loss of three quick wickets in the middle overs, including his own, that proved decisive in his teams 36-run loss to India in the second ODI here.India posted a fighting 340 for six on a flat track with opener Shikhar Dhawan top-scoring with 90-ball 96 and then bowled out the visitors for 304 to level the three-match series 1-1.The area where we lost it was losing the three wickets in between 30 and 40 overs and not having someone there that could start to launch, Smith said after the game on Friday.   If we had someone that had been out there for a while, perhaps things may have been different but that was probably where we lost it, he added.Australia lost three quick wickets between the 30 and 40 overs. Marnus Labuschagne was dismissed in the 31st over and Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav accounted  for both Alex Carrey and Smith in the 38th over which turned out to be a game changer.I thought Marnus played really well in his first outing, first bat in ODI cricket. We were going at a reasonable rate at around six an over for a while. We playing good cricket shots. I thought we timed the run (rate) reasonably well but just losing those three wickets in that 30 to 40 overs but (was) a big dent in the run chase, said Smith.According to Smith, the key to Indias victory was their partnerships in the middle.I think its just our normal one-day game plan, with the ball its trying to take wickets and stem the run rate that way, obviously they had some pretty good partnerships, Virat (Kohli), Shikhar (Dhawan) and KL Rahul played really well at the back end. They were able to form some partnerships through the middle, he said.On a personal note, Smith said it was good to be among the runs but he would have preferred if he could take his team over the line.It was nice to score a few runs, I wouldve liked to have batted a bit longer and been there in the happy hour but unfortunately, tried to cut one that stopped in the wicket a little bit and dragged it on. It was a pretty bad time. We had lost Kez (Alex Carey) in the same over.  Indian pacers used short-balls against Smith and the prolific Australian batsman said he had to think about how to play.I got a few away but I probably didnt feel great the first 20 balls I was at the crease, and then I started to find a bit of rhythm and feel a bit better. Hopefully some-time in the middle helped and I can make some more runs in Bengaluru.  ',\n",

       " 'US President Donald Trump may hold an event similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modis successful Howdy, Modi! in Houston last September when he visits India next month, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.Hindustan Times learns that it is now almost certain that the visit will happen in February, although the dates are still being worked on. The people cited in the first instance said the visit will be a stand-alone one, extend across three days, and will involve Trump visiting one Indian city apart from New Delhi. That Indian city will hold a Houston-like event, one of the people said. Ahmedabad will likely be the city, this person added, although it is yet to be finalised. Prime Minister Modi is also expected to participate in the event.Americans of Gujarati origin are likely to join the Howdy Trump show, the first person said, adding that the event is being seen by the US Presidents handlers as a good walk-up to this years US elections, especially given the number of Gujaratis in the US. The Indian diaspora is an important vote bloc, especially in the US and the UK. In the latter, for instance, they played a significant role with the vote almost shifting en masse from Labour to Conservatives.Trump and Modi are expected to sign a short-term trade deal that could grant the US companies more access to Indian markets and restore to India trade benefits withdrawn last summer. They will also discuss a longer-term trade pact that could include a Free Trade Agreement.According to the people cited in the first instance, Trumps visit is likely to be preceded by a visit by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to finalise the trade deal.A second person familiar with the matter said that the trade talks are headed in a positive direction and should be completed within a month or 45 days. Indias commerce minister Piyush Goyal and the USTR have been in constant touch, this person added.India wants the Generalized System of Preferences, which provides duty free access to the US to around 3500 products from India to be restored. In the summer of 2019, just a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his second term, the Trump administration terminated Indias eligibility for the preferential trade system. The US President has also routinely railed against Indias tariffs, termed it tariff king, and his administration has put together a thick book of grievances against India on trade  high tariffs (Harley Davidsons, for example, the president would mention frequently), trade imbalance, lack of market access, and other such.Still, the two countries have made progress, the second person said. Our first priority is restoration of GSP and the remaining issues will be worked out later.As a welcome gift to Trump, New Delhi is expected to approve the purchase of another six Apache attack helicopters from Boeing. Indeed, on the defence front, ties between the two countries have warmed. The United States renamed its Pacific military command as the Indo-Pacific Command in a nod to the growing importance of the region and ties with India. The administration also elevated Indias status to that of a NATO ally for purposes of trade in sensitive defence-related technology.The US cleared the sale of 24 MH-60R Multi-Mission helicopters  Romeo Seahawks  for an estimated cost of $2.6 billion in April 2019, and 13 MK 45 anti-surface and anti-air naval gun systems, along with ammunition and related add-ons, worth about $1.02 billion later in the year in November.India has also in the past placed an order for eight P-8I aircraft for $2.1 billion.On the security front too, ties have improved. When the US President put Pakistan on notice for its support of terrorists, New Delhi felt comforted. And the US has been steadfast in its support for India on the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council where China has repeatedly tried to raise the matter.The American president calls Prime Minister Modi a good friend, and they have indeed struck a rapport, as has been affirmed by officials on both sides. The joint appearance of Trump and Modi at the Howdy Modi outreach to the Indian diaspora in September is often cited as an example of the chemistry shared by the two leaders.The frequency of their meeting and interactions  they have met three times in the last six months, and spoken multiple times on phone  is the other pointer.In an election rally in October 2016, candidate Trump said India and the United States would be best friends and no relationship would be more important if he were elected president.He may well choose to repeat that in Ahmedabad.',\n",
       " 'BINAN (Reuters) - A Philippine city shrouded in ash from the nearby Taal volcano has turned adversity into an opportunity to help neighboring towns hit by the natural disaster. The mayor of Bian has ordered residents to collect ash blanketing homes, cars and roads and put it in sacks to be sent to a state-owned factory and turned into bricks. When the ash came, we thought wed exchange the white sand which we mix with plastics to be converted into bricks with ash. We did it and they came out sturdy, Bian Mayor Walfredo Dimaguila, 48, told Reuters. The facility can produce up to 5,000 bricks a day which will be used to rebuild schools damaged since Taal, one of the Philippines most active and deadliest volcanoes, began spewing massive clouds of ash, steam and gas on Sunday. What we plan is to turn them into hollow blocks and bricks and sell them to interested companies, Dimaguila said, adding that the proceeds would be donated to people directly affected by the restive volcano. Several buildings in lakeside towns near Taal volcano, located about 70 km (45 miles) south of the capital, were destroyed as heavy ash weighed makeshift roofs and toppled trees, and tens of thousands of people have fled their homes. Some of the evacuees are unsure if they have home and livelihood to return to. When Batangas is in recovery, we will bring the bricks there for building schools, community halls and livelihood centers so what we can give back what Taal has given us, Dimaguila said, referring to the province where Taal is located. Binan is in the neighboring province of Laguna. The misfortune of our neighbors in Batangas is there. Lets transform this into opportunity.

       " 'A  UN report on Friday said continued structural reforms are necessary to boost growth in India, which is currently facing an economic slowdown. The World Economic Situation and Prospects 2020 (WESP) report has also lowered GDP growth estimate for India while expressing hope that combination of fiscal stimulus and financial sector reforms will help boost consumption. After experiencing a sharp economic slowdown from 6.8 per cent in 2018 to 5.7 per cent in 2019, India has committed to an ambitious fiscal expansion to complement the countrys already loose monetary policy. The combination of fiscal stimulus and financial sector reforms, boosting investment and consumption, is expected to support a recovery in growth to 6.6 per cent, but it will take continued structural reforms to bring Indias growth back to its previous levels, it said. However, the data related to India was revised to 5 per cent for the current fiscal and 5.8-5.9 per cent for the next financial year, Nagesh Kumar, Head, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, said. While presenting the report, he said the GDP forecast in WESP did not take into account the latest growth numbers released by Indias National Statistical Office (NSO). The report, he said was computed in October 2019 and NSOs advanced growth estimates were released in January 2020 suggesting countrys growth would slip to 5 per cent during 2019-20 fiscal. Kumar further said Indias macro economic fundamentals are strong as ever and recovery in growth is expected in the next fiscal. According to the UN study, one in five countries will see per capita income stagnate or decline this year, but listed India among few countries where the per capita GDP growth rate could exceed 4 per cent level in 2020. A prolonged weakness in global economic activity may cause significant setbacks for sustainable development, including the goals to eradicate poverty and create decent jobs for all. At the same time, pervasive inequalities and the deepening climate crisis are fuelling growing discontent in many parts of the world. In the European Union, manufacturing will continue to be held back by global uncertainty, but this will be partially offset by steady growth in private consumption, allowing a modest rise in GDP growth from 1.4 per cent in 2019 to 1.6 per cent in 2020. Despite significant headwinds, East Asia remains the worlds fastest growing region and the largest contributor to global growth, as per the report. In China, GDP growth is projected to moderate gradually from 6.1 per cent in 2019 to 6.0 per cent in 2020 and 5.9 per cent in 2021, supported by more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. Growth in other large emerging countries, including Brazil, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and Turkey, is expected to gain some momentum in 2020, the UN report said. As the global economic balance is shifting from the EU, the US and other developed countries towards China, India and other developing countries, global economic decision-making power is shifting as well, it noted. Global cooperation mechanisms will need to recognise this shifting balance while continuing to allow the under represented to be heard, it added. The UN report also said that eradicating poverty will increasingly rely on tackling inequality going forward. ',\n",

Were terribly sad to hear the news from Nepal that Khagendra is no longer with us, said Craig Glenday, Guinness World Records editor-in-chief.Life can be challenging when you weigh just 6 kilograms and you dont fit into a world built for the average person. But Khagendra certainly didnt let his small size stop him from getting the most out of life he said.Magar became an official face of Nepals tourism campaign, which featured him as the smallest man in a country that is home to the worlds highest peak, Mount Everest.During his stint he met other short people around the world, including the shortest woman, Jyoti Amge, from India.  In a video released by Guinness World Records, Magar is seen playing a guitar with his brother, riding a bike and sitting at his familys shop. The worlds shortest non-mobile man remains Junrey Balawing of the Philippines, who measures only 59.93 centimetres but is unable to walk or stand unaided, according to Guinness World Records.The record for shortest living mobile man is now retained by Edward Nino Hernandez of Colombia, a reggaeton DJ who stands 70.21 centimeters tall, Guinness said.',\n",
       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - Social media can be a minefield for the strait-laced world of diplomacy, as the German Foreign Office just found out, when it  was forced to delete a tweet and apologize for its contribution to a mildly off-color Twitter meme. The meme was the hashtag #SeduceSomeonein4Words. Submissions on Thursday ranged from You hungry? Im cooking to Donald Trump Is Impeached. Then @GermanyDiplo, the foreign ministrys English-language channel, came up with Your visa got approved. That got hundreds of retweets and thousands of likes. But it also got a fair amount of criticism, much of it from people suffering through the process of acquiring a German visa.  Germany attracts migrants from the world over, with its free universities, strong economy, high wages and almost full employment. In 2015s migrant crisis, hundreds of thousands from the Middle East and Africa overwhelmed Europes border controls and flooded into Germany. But eye-catching influxes like that mask the thousands of daily frustrations and family tragedies that take place at the consulates of rich countries. Would-be immigrants spend fortunes and wait weeks and months applying for visas that would let them work, study, or be reunited with loved ones far away. That gives the consular officials who award the coveted stamp immense power. British and U.S. officials have been investigated for abusing that power, allegedly requiring sex in exchange for visas. So Twitter reaction was mixed. Even though its terribly hard and sometimes humiliating to try to get visa from German Consulate, the joke is still very funny! wrote Turkish journalist Rahsan Gulsan. GermanyDiplo rapidly backtracked, deleting the tweet and four hours later issuing a rueful apology. Being funny is apparently not always our strong suit, the ministry wrote. We know the visa process is complex, and visa decisions can deeply affect peoples lives. Our colleagues take these decisions very seriously. Reporting by Thomas Escritt',\n",

       " 'Former India all-rounder Bapu Nadkarni, who played 41 Tests between 1955 and 1968, passed away on Friday. He was 86-years-old. Nadkarni, who represented Mumbai and Maharashtra in domestic cricket, breathed his last at his daughters residence here.In his 41 Tests, Nadkarni claimed 88 wickets with a best of six for 63 against New Zealand at Wellington in 1968. He averaged 25.70 with the bat hitting seven half-centuries and one century122 not out against England at Kanpur in February 1964and scored 1,414 runs in 67 innings.In the times of T20 proliferation, statisticians and fans together wonder how valuable Nadkarni would have been in the present age with his measly bowling spells, as famously in the 1964 Test between India and England at Chennai (formerly Madras), Nadkarni bowled a mind-boggling 21 maidens on the trot in his spell of 32-27-5-0.But perhaps the first display of his capabilities to keep batsmen tied up came at Kanpur against Pakistan in December 1960-61, when he gave away a mere 23 runs from 32 overs, sending down a staggering 24 maiden overs as the visitors clambered to 335 in as many as 188.5 overs. Even in the second innings of the Testwherein India used as many as nine bowling optionshis figures were 7-4-6-0.His career bowling economy rate of 1.67 in Test cricket was similar to his figures in First-Class cricket of 1.64. Known for working persistently on his bowling, Nadkarni is also said to use to have placed a coin on good length during his long nets sessions.Nadkarni made his Test debut when Vinoo Mankad rested himself for the New Delhi Test against New Zealand. Nadkarni made an unbeaten 68 on debut, but had to wait for three more years to play his next Testagainst West Indies in Mumbai in November 1958.His best outing with the bat came in the drawn Test against England during the 1963-64 tour at Kanpur, wherein Nadkarni scored a fighting 52 at No 9 as India replied with 266 to the visitors 559 for eight declared. Batting at No 3 in the next innings as India followed-on, Nadkarni scored his career-best 122 not out hitting 15 fours to help the hosts force a draw.In his next match, Nadkarni registered his best bowling performance in a match taking five for 31 and six for 91, but India s batting failure in the second innings resulted in a 139-run loss at Chennai in October 1964.In domestic circuit, Nadkarni was an all-round champion. In 191 First-Class matches, he claimed 500 wickets with 19 five-wicket hauls and one 10-wicket match haul. He averaged more than 40 with the bat, hitting 14 centuries and 46 half-centuries to garner 8,880 runs.',\n",

       " 'Following a BBC investigation, Twitter has apologized for allowing adverts to be micro-targeted at certain users such as neo-Nazis, homophobes and other hate groups. The investigation found that it was possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including transphobic, white-supremacists and anti-gay,. Twitter allowed adverts to be directed at users who has posted about or searched for specific topics. Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that Twitters advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance. What is the problem?Like all other social media companies, Twitter also creates user profiles by collecting data on things they post, like and share. Advertisers take advantage of these profiles by using tools to select their campaign audience from the list of characteristics like  parents of teenagers or amateur photographers. Twitter can also control who sees their message by using keywords and gives advertisers an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result. For example, BBC explained, a car website wanting to reach people using the term petrolhead would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people.Twitters keywords are supposed to be restricted but the BBC investigation revealed that it was possible to advertise to users using the term neo-Nazi. The ad tool had indicated that in the UK, this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people, reported BBC. How did the BBC test this?BBC created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account, saying Happy New Year and then targeted three different sets of audiences based on sensitive keywords. Twitters website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched, and the BBCs ad initially went into a pending state. However, it was approved soon and ran for a few hours before BBC pulled it down. In that time, 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached, which directed them to a news article about memes. Running the ad cost 3.84 pounds, reported BBC adding that targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do.According to Twitters tool, a campaign using the keywords islamophobes, islamaphobia, islamophobic and #islamophobic had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users. It was also possible to advertise to vulnerable groups, like an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using words like anorexic, bulimic, anorexia and bulimia.Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people. The post was seen by 255 users, and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it, BBC reported. What did campaigners say?An anti-extremist charity called Hope Not Hate said it feared that Twitters ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right.I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas, said Patrik Hermansson, its social media researcher.An eating disorder charity called Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused.Ive been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements, weight loss supplements, spinal corrective surgery, said Daniel Magson, the organisations chairman.Its quite triggering for me, and Im campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament. So, its great news that Twitter has now acted, Magson added. What did Twitter say?Twitter said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting, but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly.[Our] preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms, which we update on a continuous basis, Twitter said in a statement.In this instance, some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes. This was an error. Were very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue, we rectified it. We continue to enforce our ads policies, including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas, including inappropriate content targeting minors, Twitter added. ',\n",
       " 'Irans supreme leader has delivered a rare sermon at Friday prayers in Tehran in which he described Donald Trump as a clown who pretended to support the Iranian people but would push a poisonous dagger into their backs.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei struck a defiant tone following weeks of domestic and international turbulence, including the US killing of a top general, missile attacks on US military bases in Iraq and the accidental downing of an airliner that killed 176 people.The mass public gatherings at funeral processions for the powerful General Qassem Suleimani showed the deep support of the people for the Islamic Republic, Khamenei said, and the Revolutionary Guards stood ready to take their fight beyond Irans borders.His sermon came as the US revealed that 11 of its troops had been injured in Iranian missile strikes on two US bases in Iraq on 8 January, contradicting earlier statements by the US president that no Americans had been injured. Iran launched its missile attack in response to the US assassination of Suleimani, its most senior military leader, on 3 January.Trump responded with a series of tweets on Friday evening. The so-called Supreme Leader of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe, he wrote. In another, translated into Farsi, he called on Iranian leaders to abandon terror and Make Iran Great Again!.Irans embattled regime is reeling from a wave of international condemnation and domestic criticism after admitting its forces shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane and then lied in an attempt to cover up its role in the tragedy. Scenes of mourning for Suleimani were followed by four days of protests over the plane disaster, when demonstrators chanted Death to Khamenei and Clerics get lost. The demonstrations were quickly dispersed by the authorities with live ammunition and tear gas.In Fridays sermon Khamenei focused on national unity in the face of external enemies.Trumps cowardly killing of Suleimani had taken out the most effective commander in the battle against Islamic State, he said.In response to the 3 January killing in Baghdad, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles targeting US troops in Iraq. Khamenei said the strike had dealt a blow to Americas image as a superpower. In part of the sermon delivered in Arabic, he said the real punishment would be in forcing the US to withdraw from the Middle East.As Irans Revolutionary Guard Corps braced for an American counterattack that never came, it mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 shortly after it took off from Tehrans international airport, killing all 176 passengers on board, mostly Iranians.Most of the passengers were heading to Canada, and 57 were Canadian citizens. On Friday, Canadas prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged Iran to send the jets flight data and cockpit recorders to France for analysis.Iran does not have the level of technical expertise  and mostly the equipment necessary to be able to analyse these damaged black boxes quickly, Trudeau said.Khamenei called the downing of the plane a bitter accident that saddened Iran as much as it made its enemies happy. He said Irans enemies had seized on the crash to question the Islamic Republic, the Revolutionary Guards and the armed forces.He also lashed out at western countries, saying they themselves were too weak to bring Iranians to their knees. The UK, France and Germany, which this week triggered a dispute mechanism to try to bring Iran back into compliance with the unravelling 2015 nuclear agreement, were contemptible governments and servants of the US, he said.Iran was willing to negotiate, but not with the Washington, the supreme leader added.Khamenei has held the countrys top office since 1989 and has the final say on all major decisions. Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, had become well known among Iranians and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his fathers debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraqs streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.Once described by American commander David Petraeus as a truly evil figure, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. You will start the war but we will end it.Michael SafiThousands of people attended the Friday prayers, occasionally interrupting his speech by chanting: God is greatest and Death to America.Tensions between Tehran and Washington have steadily escalated since Trump withdrew the US from Irans 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which had imposed restrictions on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.The US has since imposed crippling sanctions on Iran, including its vital oil and gas industry, pushing the country into an economic crisis that has ignited several waves of sporadic, leaderless protests. Trump has openly encouraged the protesters, even tweeting in Farsi, hoping that the protests and the sanctions will bring about fundamental change in a longtime adversary.After Suleimani was killed, Iran announced it would no longer be bound by the limitations in the nuclear agreement. The dispute mechanism triggered by European signatories this week has been widely seen as the deals death knell and could result in even more sanctions.Khamenei was always sceptical of the nuclear agreement, arguing that the US could not be trusted, but he allowed President Hassan Rouhani  a relative moderate  to conclude the agreement with Barack Obama. Since Trumps withdrawal, he has repeatedly said there can be no negotiations with the US.',\n",

Rohit's steady 42-run knock laced by as many as six boundaries helped himcomplete 7,000 ODI runs as an opener. The Indian vice-captain not only touched down the 7,000 run mark but the 32-year-old is also the quickest to scale mount 7k in the 50-over format.Rohit has outclassed the likes of Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar and former South African great Hashim Amla to become the quickest opener with 7,000 ODI runs.Rohit took 137 innings to unlock the 7k milestone while the previous best was recorded by Amla, who reached the same feat in 160 innings.

If you look at the context of what I said, I was trying to convey that investments should come within the rules and regulations. It is the same everywhere in the world. We welcome investment within those rules and regulations. But because of that investment, an unfair competition should not be created for the small kirana stores. They dont get loans in zero interest rate, they dont have millions of rupees, they do their business with small investments. We want the investment to come within the set legal criteria,\" Goyal told reporters at the sidelines of an event in Ahmadabad.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, currently on a three-day visit to India, on Wednesday pledged $1 billion in new investments to help take 10 million small Indian businesses online.Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue event, Goyal on Thursday questioned the reason behind the losses that e-commerce giant Amazon is making in India. They may have put in a billion dollars, but if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then jolly well they have to finance that billion dollars. So, its not as if they are doing a great favour to India when they invest a billion dollars,\" Goyal said.Goyal on Friday maintained that if any investment is outside the limits of law, then the legal process will take its own course.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday ordered a probe into alleged competition law violations by Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart over allegations that the e-commerce majors promoted and gave discounts to preferred\" sellers, entered into exclusive partnerships with smartphone brands and abused their dominant position. The antitrust body said exclusive arrangements between mobile phone brands and e-commerce platforms selling exclusively on either of the platforms merit an investigation.Criticising Goyal for his comment, former finance minister P.

When I first started working, we were told, Heroes will decide who the heroine is going to be. This was 2002 or 2003; it was on the beck and call of main actors. Im sure it still happens with a lot of films, but what has changed is the audience, and the acceptance of watching films with content instead of the gender of the lead actor. Thats one big change weve seen, says the 37-year-old, who was last seen in The Sky is Pink (2019).Cannot wait to work with the talented @_richardmadden and incredible @Russo_Brothers on CITADEL...

When I did Fashion, everyone told me, Women do female-oriented films  I hate that word  when they want to win awards at the end of their careers.

After his return from the foreign trip, which was allowed by the January 2019 order, Karti filed a plea in the Supreme Court for the return of ~10 crore.However, the bench headed by then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi turned down that prayer. Gogoi told Karti to pay attention to your constituency while dismissing his plea on May 29, 2019. Karti is being probed by the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation in the INX Media case for his role in the alleged irregularities in the Foreign Investment Promotion Boards clearance to the group for receiving overseas funds of ~307 crore.The clearance was given when Kartis father P Chidambaram was serving as the Union finance minister.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Google-parent Alphabet Inc became on Thursday the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion, some funds holding its shares are wondering whether now is the time to cash in on the stocks extraordinary gains. Shares of the Internet search giant are up nearly 17% over the last three months, outpacing a broader rally in the S&P 500 index over the same period by 6 percentage points. Short interest in the stock, a measure of how many investors are betting on a price decline, is at 1%, near a 52-week high for the company and higher than competitors such as Microsoft and Facebook, according to Refinitv data. Alphabet joins Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies to hit $1 trillion in market value. Google is a stock that wont get you fired, said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who hasnt added to his current Alphabet position since the first quarter of 2019. Will I be able to double my money in this stock from here? Im not sure about that. Alphabets shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes.  Despite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28% climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up.  Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabets exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation. Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500.  Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the companys costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said. Alphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors bullishness on the company: Alphabets stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later. Bearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July. Shares of the company are down nearly 7% over the last six months, compared with a 10% gain in the S&P 500 overall.  Reporting by David Randall; editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Cynthia Osterman',\n",

The authorities  the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Mumbai Police  have permitted such establishments across the city, which fall under gated communities, and non-residential areas, to stay open 24x7 from January 27, according to municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi. The decision was taken in a meeting called by state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday. The meeting was attended by the civic chief and commissioner of police Sanjay Barve. Representatives of shopping malls, hotels and restaurants were also present at the meeting.At least 25 malls and several other shops and restaurants across the city can stay open throughout, however, it is up to the owners discretion to keep them open 24x7 or not, in view of the business benefits. The owners can also decide which days they can keep their establishments open round-the-clock  several of them would prefer Friday to Sunday. Gated communities refer to places that have CCTV surveillance, parking facilities, ensure the safety of the people approaching the place and where noise is curtailed, explained a government official. Permission for Kamala Mills to stay open 24x7 is being reviewed as ward officers, police will find out the feasibility of malls in their areas. This will be followed by an assessment of the implementation.Pardeshi said, We have given permission for 24x7 functioning from January 27. Gated communities, primarily with entertainment and food plazas, have been given permissions. We have cautioned the representatives of the establishments to ensure fire-safety compliance and security. Most of the malls have said that they will keep it open on weekends if running it throughout the week is not feasible for them.However, another official said that even though establishments have been told that they can start from January 27, they can start to implement this at any moment from now as the government has issued a notification regarding this a year ago. Some of the malls that have agreed for the 24x7 implementation are Atria Mall in Worli, R-City Mall in Ghatkopar, Oberoi Mall in Goregaon, Growels 101 in Kandivli Phoenix Market City in Kurla and High Street Phoenix in Lower Parel. Meanwhile, those establishments that serve alcohol can serve till 1.30am at the latest, in accordance with the existing rule.A senior civic official who was present at the meeting said, The most important thing that Mr Thackeray wanted is generation of employment and that tourism is increased. Also, ease of facilitation of services along with ensuring security is what the government will be insisting. Almost all representatives have welcomed the move, assuring self-regulation, while knowing that flouting norms would derail the entire plan and hamper their business as well.Shiv Sena first mooted the concept in 2013, and has been following up on it since, with Thackeray pushing for it. In January 2018, the state government had issued a notification, amending the Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Services) Act to allow shops, malls, restaurants that do not serve alcohol to operate all night long. However, the police department raised security concerns for Mumbai, and the issue was sent to the Home Ministry for approval.Gurbaxish Singh, President of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, We thank the tourism minister and his initiative to make Mumbai a successful tourist hub.

Last week, fires across the north-east of Victoria merged with fires in the NSW Snowy Valley, creating a huge complex of fires across the state border.Here are nine images, before and after the fires, that show the devastation from beach to bush, farm to forest, across NSW and South Australia.Many more fires are still burning  especially in Victorias East Gippsland and the NSW south coast  and the full visual aftermath will only be known when weather conditions improve.Harrington, 60km south of Port Macquarie, was hit by fires before summer even started.The NSW mid-north coast bore the brunt in early November, when fires killed four and destroyed hundreds of homes.In Harrington, water-bombing aircraft dropped bright pink fire retardant on homes after a fire in Crowdy Bay national park threatened.The fire in Crowdy Bay national park grew to more than 12,000 hectares.Across the mid-north coast, up to 30% of the regions koala habitat was destroyed in the fires, in what the NSW environment minister said could have killed a third of the koala population.The seaside town of Forster, also on the mid-north coast, was ringed by fires in November.The Pacific Highway was cut to the south and Failford Road was cut to the north, as residents gathered at the Tuncurry bowling club evacuation centre.Homes were also declared to be in immediate danger at nearby Wallabi Point as the 21,000 hectare Hillville Road fire flared to emergency level.In Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, actor Russell Crowes house was nearly destroyed by the fires in November.At one point, the Liberation Trail fire grew to a perimeter of 1,000km as it burnt through homes and properties.In South Australias Adelaide Hills, the Cudlee Creek fire tore through the region in December, just days before Christmas.In Lenswood, fires burned crops, vineyards and farms.

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Irans supreme leader threw his support behind the elite Revolutionary Guards in a rare sermon on Friday after their belated admission that they had accidentally downed an airliner triggered days of street protests. In his first Friday prayers sermon for eight years, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also told worshippers chanting Death to America that the elite Guards could take their fight beyond Irans borders after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian commander. U.S. President Donald Trump hit back later on Twitter, writing that Khamenei should be careful what he says. Khameneis address came amid a deepening crisis for Iran as it grapples with unrest at home and rising pressure from abroad. Tension has steadily ratcheted higher since 2018, when the United States withdrew from Tehrans nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have hammered the economy. The standoff erupted into tit-for-tat military strikes this month, when Washington killed top commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike on Jan. 3 and Iran launched missile strikes at U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8. In the tense aftermath, a Ukrainian airliner was shot down by mistake. But it took days for the Guards to admit this and protesters directed their rage at the elite force and the clerical system it was set up to defend. Our enemies ... were happy that they found an excuse to undermine the Guards, the armed forces and our system, Khamenei said in his sermon, heaping praise on the Guards for protecting Iran and renewing a call for U.S. troops to leave the region. Khamenei said Soleimanis work of projecting Irans military influence abroad would continue and said the Quds Force he commanded protects oppressed nations across the region. He said Quds Force soldiers were fighters without borders. The U.S. State Departments special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said in Washington that Iranian threats risked further isolating the country. But Russia lent Iran some support over the airliner disaster, saying it had been shot down when Tehran was spooked by reports of advanced U.S. stealth fighters in the area. Id like to underline the edginess that always accompanies such situations, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Protests led by students erupted in Tehran and other cities for four days over the shooting down of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, in which all 176 aboard were killed, mostly Iranians or dual nationals. As the unrest picked up, Trump sent tweets in Farsi and English supporting the protesters, who were chanting Death to Khamenei and slogans against the Guards. Khamenei said in his sermon: These American clowns who lie and say they are with the Iranian people should see who the Iranian people are. Trump responded on Twitter: The so-called Supreme Leader of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words! Khamenei said the shooting down of the plane was a bitter tragedy that burned through our heart, but stopped short of offering a direct apology. Some tried to use it as an excuse to overshadow the martyrdom of our great commander Soleimani, he said, urging Iranians to unite and show solidarity by turning out in numbers for the February parliamentary election. The funeral of Soleimani, long portrayed as a national hero in Iran but seen by the West as a ruthless adversary, had brought huge numbers of Iranian mourners to the streets. On social media, some Iranians reacted angrily to Khameneis sermon and his comments on the plane disaster. Not a word of apology. Only arrogance, tweeted Mike Pouraryan. Online footage during demonstrations had shown protesters being beaten and recordings of gunshots. Riot police were deployed in force on the streets, particularly outside universities, a focus for the unrest. Irans police denied firing at protesters. Two months earlier, police launched a bloody crackdown on protests that erupted over sharp fuel price hikes, which added to the suffering of Iranians already hurt by U.S. sanctions. In reaction to Washingtons maximum pressure policy, Tehran has gradually scaled back on commitments to the nuclear deal, including lifting limits on its uranium enrichment. Britain, France and Germany, which have been trying to salvage the pact, have subsequently launched the deals dispute mechanism over Irans violations, starting a diplomatic process that could lead to reimposing U.N. sanctions. These European countries cannot be trusted. Even their negotiations with Iran are full of deceit, Khamenei said.

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - All countries involved in the Ukrainian airliner crash in Iran should avoid turning it into a political issue, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Friday. We request all sides not to make human issues, particularly this tragic accident, into an excuse for political gestures, Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency. Five countries whose citizens died when Iran shot down the airliner last week said on Thursday that Tehran should pay compensation to families of the victims, and that the world was watching for its response. Mousavi said Iran had cooperated beyond expectations with countries whose citizens were killed in the crash, according to ISNA. Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and Britain also said after a meeting of officials in London that Iran should hold a thorough, independent and transparent international investigation open to grieving nations.  Irans elite Revolutionary Guards admitted accidentally shooting down the Ukrainian airliner with a missile, killing all 176 aboard.  Mousavi said it was strange that Canadas foreign ministry had asked for consular access related to the crash, noting that almost all of the victims of the crash have been identified.

       " 'The wife of the Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang says she was sexually assaulted by her obstetrician-gynecologist while she was pregnant with the couples first child.Evelyn Yang said in an interview televised on Thursday by CNN that the assault happened in 2012, and she was initially afraid to tell anyone. She and 31 other women are now suing the doctor and hospital system, saying they conspired and enabled the crimes.Yang said she she was encouraged to speak out after seeing the positive reception she and her husband had been getting on the campaign trail by being open about their sons autism.Something about being on the trail and meeting people and seeing the difference that weve been making already has moved me to share my own story about it, about sexual assault, she told CNN.Yang said she first began seeing Dr Robert Hadden in New York in early 2012. As the months went on, Yang said, Hadden began asking her inappropriate questions about her sexual activity, and he spent more time conducting examinations.When she was seven months pregnant, Yang said, she believed her appointment was done and she was getting ready to leave when the doctor told her abruptly that he thought she might need a cesarean section. She said Hadden pulled her to him and undressed her, then used his fingers to examine her internally.I knew it was wrong. I knew I was being assaulted, she said.But Yang said she just kind of froze and didnt react. I remember trying to fix my eyes on a spot on the wall and just trying to avoid seeing his face as he was assaulting me, just waiting for it to be over, she told CNN.After the doctor left the room, she left the practice and didnt return.Haddens lawyer has denied Yangs allegations in legal filings. His attorney declined a request to be interviewed by CNN.Yang said she initially didnt tell anyone what had happened to her. She said she blamed herself, thinking she must have done something to invite this kind of behavior.Months later, after the couples son was born, Yang got a letter in the mail saying Hadden had left the practice. Curious, she looked him up online and saw that another woman had made a police report accusing him of assaulting her.She said she realized then that she wasnt to blame for his actions.This was a serial predator, and he just picked me as his prey, she told CNN.She said only then was she able to reveal the abuse to her husband.In a statement Thursday, Andrew Yang said he was extraordinarily proud of his wife and no one deserved to be treated as she was.When victims of abuse come forward, they deserve our belief, support, and protection, Yang said. I hope that Evelyns story gives strength to those who have suffered and sends a clear message that our institutions must do more to protect and respond to women.He later tweeted: I love my wife very very much.Evelyn Yang said several women had forward with similar stories about Hadden, and she had learned the Manhattan district attorneys office had an open case against him.In 2016, she said, the DAs office agreed to a deal with Hadden in which he pleaded guilty to one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual assault. He also lost his medical license and had to register as the lowest level of sex offender.Yang said she felt betrayed by the plea deal, which allowed the doctor to avoid jail. The counts he pleaded to didnt involve her case, she said.Cyrus Vance Jr, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement to CNN: Because a conviction is never a guaranteed outcome in a criminal trial, our primary concern was holding him accountable and making sure he could never do this again  which is why we insisted on a felony conviction and permanent surrender of his medical license.Yang and 31 other women are now suing Columbia University, where Hadden worked, along with its affiliates and the doctor itself, saying they actively concealed, conspired, and enabled Haddens crimes, according to CNN.The lawsuit claims that medical assistants who worked with the doctor knew of the abuse but didnt intervene because of a power imbalance and lack of training, CNN said.Hadden has denied the additional allegations in court papers, CNN reported. Columbia University and the hospital system are fighting the lawsuit on procedural grounds, according to CNN.A university spokeswoman told CNN in response to a detailed list of questions that the accusations are abhorrent and they deeply apologize to those whose trust was violated.',\n",

I dont think a guy who is coming out of a situation like that needs to be taken advantage of.

We need to all take responsibility towards that. Intimidate the opposition, definitely try and have an upper hand but in a matter that is not targeting someone emotionally. That is not acceptable at any level and people should be wary of that. Nearly three years ago, Kohli stirred up a major controversy by virtually accusing the then Australian captain Smith of cheating in the usage of DRS.

A passenger train rolls between Bichhupali and Bolangir station twice everyday on the 16.8-kilometre-long track.Panda had sent an RTI query last month to the East Coast railway seeking details of expenditure and income on the railway station. He got a reply that Railways earns a daily revenue of Rs 20. Panda was, however, not given any details of the expenditure.The track between Bolangir and Bichhupali was built at a cost of Rs 115 crore.Chief public relation officer of East Coast Railway, JP Mishra said the station would earn more revenue once it is connected to Sonepur station by next year. The key is connectivity. People from Bichhupali want to travel to Sambalpur, Titalagarh and Bhawanipatna which is not possible now. We are expecting once the doubling of railway line between Sonepur and Titlagarh is over, we will get more passengers, said Mishra.At a time when the Railways is spending more than what it earns (the operating ratio for 2018-19 was 97.3 per cent compared to 98.4 in 2017-18), many see running a station like this a huge burden on railway.

It had a 30.79% market share at the end of October. Unlike its rivals, Jios user base comprises entirely of 4G subscribers.To be sure, the company had already become number one in terms of revenue market share last year when it grabbed 31.7% share of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) that the industry recorded in the April-June period.The subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with cheap data plans and handsets, which led to an unprecedented rise in mobile data consumption, with an average user consuming 11 gigabytes of data per month.In the subsequent disruption, half a dozen companies either shut shop or were acquired by bigger companies. Reliance Communications and Aircel filed for bankruptcy, while Airtel acquired Telenor India and Tatas consumer mobility business.As the dust settled, the domestic telecom market has now become largely a three-way tussle between Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone Idea and Jio.While the telecom industry witnessed shrinking revenue streams, bankruptcy and, finally, consolidation, the last three years have been monumental as 4G coverage soared and became a catalyst for the growth of mobile data and new applications and services, especially in the content ecosystem.Bharti Airtel, which has battled Jios aggressive tariffs, too posted an increase in market share in November, adding 1.65 million users to end with 327.30 million users and a 28.35% market share.Indias mobile user base however fell by 28.81 million subscribers in November as the increase in the subscriber base at Jio and Bharti Airtel failed to compensate for the subscriber losses at Vodafone Idea.This was the biggest decline since April 2018 when the user base fell by 58 million.Vodafone Idea lost a record 36.41 million users in November, ending with a 29.12% market share or 336.25 million subscribers. In October, the company had added 189,901 subscribers.Excluding October, Vodafone Idea has lost subscribers each month after it started operating as a new entity after the merger of Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd in September 2018.State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd too increased its market share to 10.19% from 9.92% at the end of October, adding 341,722 users to end November with 117.68 million users.The total wireless subscriber base of 1.15 billion comprised 979.09 million active users in November.

       " 'NEW DELHI :In mounting trouble for AirAsia Bhd, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned its chief executive, Tony Fernandes, on 20 January in an ongoing probe against the airline for allegedly lobbying the Indian government to secure overseas flight permits and violating rules that bar foreign airlines from controlling Indian carriers.The agency has also issued summons to other senior officials of the airline under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The person did not identify the other AirAsia officials.ED is also investigating irregularities of funds as well as criminal misconduct against the carrier when it was lobbying for a licence to start services in India.AirAsia India is owned 51% by Tata Sons, while AirAsia has a 49% stake. It operates more than 175 daily flights to over 20 destinations across the country.A spokesperson for AirAsia India declined to comment. Kuala Lumpur-based AirAsia Group was not immediately available for comment.The action against Fernandes comes more than a year after both agencies, ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), started their separate probes into the matter.In June 2018, ED widened its probe into the AirAsia money laundering case, after collecting documents from the ministry of commerce and industry concerning FDI clearances given to the airline.The agency has been investigating the FDI proposal made by the airline and clearances given by the erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board to AirAsia so that it could launch its operations in India.In May 2018, ED had filed a criminal case of money laundering against AirAsia officials and others for allegedly trying to manipulate government policies through corrupt means to get an international licence for its Indian venture, AirAsia India Ltd.The agency had pressed charges under PMLA to probe the trail of funds that was used to create illegal assets. At the time, CBI had searched the offices of AirAsia India and filed a complaint against Fernandes for allegedly lobbying the government to secure overseas flight permits for the Indian entity.CBIs first information report (FIR) filed in May 2018 said the violations occurred from 2013 to 2016, ahead of the government easing curbs on local airlines starting overseas flights in June 2016.BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had approached the Delhi high court in 2016, seeking suspension of AirAsias licence. He was joined by the Federation of Indian Airlines comprising IndiGo, Jet Airways, GoAir and SpiceJet. In November 2016, the court directed the aviation regulator to conduct an inquiry.The FIR, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint, also names AirAsias deputy CEO Tharumalingam Kanagalingam, former AirAsia India director Ramachandran Venkataramanan, HNR Trading Pte Ltds Rajender Dubey, Travel/Total Food Services Sunil Kapoor, AirAsia India and its parent and unknown government officials.',\n",
       " 'Bharti Airtel has expressed disappointment after the Supreme Court rejected the plea by telecom companies seeking a review of the order on interpretation of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). The telecom company said it is considering filing a curative petition. While respecting the Honble Supreme Courts decision, we would like to express our disappointment as we believe the long standing disputes raised regarding the AGR definition were bonafide and genuine, said an Airtel spokesperson in a statement.The industry continues to face severe financial stress and the outcome could further erode the viability of the sector as a whole. The industry needs to continue to invest in expanding networks, acquiring spectrum and introducing New Technologies like 5G. The money now required to pay punitive interest, penalty and interest on penalty which forms nearly 75% of AGR dues would have better served the digital mission of the country, the spokesperson added.The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)  said it was deeply disappointed by the court verdict. While we respect the Honble Supreme Courts order dismissing the industrys review petition of AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) matter, the telecom sector is again deeply disappointed. The sector, which is currently reeling under a debt of INR 4 lakh crore, is a key contributor to the Indian economy in terms of consumer benefit, employment, revenue generation and contributes 6.5% to the GDP, said COAIRajan S Mathews, DG, COAI in a statement.The sector is already facing heavy taxes & levies in the range of 29% to 32%, which are globally the highest. The Supreme Courts dismissal of the review petition is the last straw in contributing to financial distress and it remains to be seen whether the industry will be able to recover from this setback. This added financial pressure on the sector will also adversely impact Honble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modis vision of Digital India, he added.The Supreme Court in October last year had allowed the Centres petition to recover AGR about Rs 92,000 crore from the telecom companies. The apex court had directed the companies to make the payments within three months of the verdict. The verdict was considered as a big setback to the telecom companies which said tax and levies were already high for the telecom sector in India.

Australias Prime Minister Scott Morrison secured re-election in May 2019, defying polls that had indicated voters would punish the conservative government for the backbench revolt that ousted former leader Malcolm Turnbull in 2018.  Looking to regain lost support in the run-up to the election, Morrisons government promised increased spending on local sport, but the Australian National Audit Office said late on Tuesday that then Minister for Sport Bridget McKenzie used the public funds to win favor with voters.  The report said 400 projects received funding. The Australian National Audit Office said more than 70% of those that received funding had done so without any endorsement by the governing body for sport in Australia. The award of funding reflected the approach documented by the ministers office of focusing on marginal electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or independent members that were to be targeted by the Coalition at the 2019 election, the report read. The report fuels pressure on Morrison, who is already struggling under a barrage of criticism over his governments handing of ragging bushfires that have destroyed an area the size of Bulgaria. McKenzie did not dispute the findings of the report, though she insisted no rules had been broken. Ministerial discretion was actually written into the guidelines for a purpose, McKenzie told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio.

It is meant to be fired at the legs. But you see how a stone pelter operates. I will show you positions, they are picking up stones from the ground while some are standing. So, when the forces are firing at the legs, there are some people whose face is touching the ground while picking up stones. So the pellet goes and hits the face, Gen Rawat said.File image | Courtesy: PTIThe soldier is not aiming for the face but he is aiming for the legs. But if at that stage, you are picking up a stone and your face is at leg height, obviously your face will get hit.

       " 'Larry Ellisons faith in Tesla Inc. and his friend Elon Musk is being rewarded. The Oracle Corp. chairman bought 3 million shares of the electric-vehicle maker before joining Teslas board in December 2018. The stake -- worth $1 billion at the time -- is now worth more than $1.6 billion. The stock has surged 25% in just the first two weeks of 2020 as fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries exceeded estimates and Musk started handing over locally assembled cars to customers in China.For most of 2019, Ellisons investment was floundering as Musk, Teslas chief executive officer, bounced from crisis to crisis and Wall Street cast skepticism on consumer demand. On the day Ellisons holding and his appointment to the board were disclosed, the shares closed at $333.87. By June, they had plunged to a low $176.99. On Tuesday, the stock rose as much as 4.3% at the open to a new intraday high of $547.41.The rally is bringing Tesla even closer to a $100 billion market capitalization, the threshold that would unlock the first tranche of Musks all-or-nothing pay package approved in March 2018. The company will have to sustain that value for months for the CEO to get his award worth around $346 million.At least one investor may have less reason to rejoice. Saudi Arabias sovereign-wealth fund hedged most of its 5% stake in Tesla through an arrangement with JPMorgan Chase & Co. last January, according to the Financial Times. That helped protect gains when the share price was below about $350, but the kingdom would have missed out on the recent rally, assuming the hedge remained in place.Musk himself has most to cheer.

       " 'US President Donald Trump signed Wednesday a partial, Phase I deal with China which, he said before the signing, was a momentous step towards a future of fair and reciprocal trade between the two countries. Signed by Vice-Premier Liu He for the Chinese, the deal will put on pause a two-year-long trade war between the worlds two largest economies that had shaken up the global economy.The agreement includes a major commitment by China to make significant reforms in a wide range of critical areas and to make substantial additional purchases of American goods and services in the coming years, the White House said in a note backgrounding the agreement. This agreement is strengthened by a strong dispute resolution system that ensures prompt and effective implementation and enforcement of the deal.Today we take a momentous step one that has never been taken before with China as we sign phase one of the trade deal, Trump said, announcing the conclusion of the agreement at a White House event attended by lawmakers, officials and supporters and the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, who had spearheaded President Richard Nixons outreach to and the 1972 visit to China that led to the thaw in relations between the two countries.Vice-Premier Liu read out a message from President Xi Jinping in which the latter stressed the need for equality and mutual respect in tackling issues and implement the deal in real earnestness. Xi also said he hoped that US treats Chinese companies fairly.China will buy $200 billion worth of US farm produce and other goods under the terms of the agreement that runs into 86 pages. It will also liberalize its financial services sector to grant access to American companies, end forced transfer of technology through acquisitions, end currency manipulation, work towards balancing trade between the two countries and also punish it companies found to have stolen proprietary intellectual property and patented technology.In return, the United States will halve tariffs on $120 billion of goods from China, and shelve for now further levies. But import duties on $360 billion of Chinese goods will remain in force, to make sure, according to news reports citing unidentified US officials, China delivered on its commitments.These tariffs will stay in place until theres a phase two. If the president gets a phase two quickly, hell consider releasing tariffs as part of phase two, Treasury Secretary Steven told reporters. If not, there wont be any tariff relief. So it has nothing to do with the election or anything else. Theres no secret agreements.On Monday, the United States dropped its designation of China as a currency manipulator, which it had announced last August. Beijing has given enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation, Mnuchin had said in a statement This is going to be a part of the deal to be announced Wednesday.Critics of the president however called the deal weak and accuses the administration of giving up prematurely. Based on the reports weve seen so far, the commitments China is making, including on forced technology transfer, currency manipulation, and intellectual property protection, are almost all vague, weak, or covered by previous announcements and existing agreements, said former Vice-President Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to take on Trump in November.Indian trade negotiators will be watching the signing closely and will study the agreement carefully as they wrap up their own trade talks with American negotiators  for a short-term trade deal with a longer-term version left for later  with an eye on a late-February visit to India by President Trump.Trump, who had campaigned on the promise of ending Chinas unfair trade practices, which he said Wednesday was his key motivating factor, set the ball rolling in April 2017 with an announcement of a 100-day plan to fix trade deficit after a meeting with Chinas Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago. The deadline passed without an agreement.It was downhill thereafter. Over the following months the two countries slapped tariffs on each other with China tactically targeting Trumps supporters in the midwest, the soybean farmers. It hurt, and Trump complained about Chinese interference in domestic politics. But he kept dialing up the pressure, putting almost all of the half-trillion worth of imports from China under stiff tariffs.The two sides also talked, but fittingly. One time late 2019, they came close to announcing a deal and then the Chinese backed out of key commitments that left the American, including the president, seething with anger. They accused Chine was reneging, and more tariffs followed.They have had better luck this time. So far. There is a deal in place, but closely guarded apart from the details officials chose to release. Top negotiators from the two sides had dinner together Tuesday night, according to a news report. A few hours later, they will go out and make history. ',\n",

       " 'After Kolkata and Prayagraj, New Delhis Shaheen Bagh protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and a proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) inspired a similar sit-in in Kota.More than a hundred Muslim women from different localities of the city began the sit-in outside the Eidgah grounds, calling it the Shaheen Bagh of Kota, on Tuesday night.When the women of the country are organising protests against the CAA and the proposed NRC, how could women of Kota be behind? The new law is a black law against the spirit of Constitution, said 28-year-old Shifa Khalid, convenor of the sit-in.Women in Kota got inspired by the protesters of Shaheen Bagh. Our sit-in is also indefinite, she added.Khalid said women in the sit-in are getting food and blankets from the neighbourhood because most of the women are from Kishorepura locality, close to the venue of the sit-in. Women of all age groups from localities such as Vigyan Nagar, Waqf Nagar and Kishorepura are sitting in the protest since Tuesday night.I have joined the dharna because the government wants our documents to prove we are Indian citizens even though several generations of my family have lived here, said Maqbool, 75, of Indira market locality.Shabana Farhat, 39, travelled nine kilometre from her home near the railway station to join the protest. Despite the cold wave conditions in the city, she spent the night at the spot with more than half a dozen women.Many women go home to finish the household chores and return to the sit-in later. The sit-in will continue until the CAA is withdrawn, she said.In New Delhi, hundreds of people have occupied a stretch of road in Shaheen Bagh to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and a proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) for almost a month.The protest has spread to other cities such as Kolkata and Prayagraj. In Kolkatas sprawling Park Circus Maidan, hundreds of Muslim women have held a round-the-clock sit-in for eight days. The sit-in in Kolkata began on January 7 following social worker Asmat Jameels call for it. Many of the participants are first-time protesters, mostly students and homemakers.The CAA to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims, who have entered India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before 2015, has triggered protests across the country.In Prayagraj, an indefinite sit-in against the CAA, NRC and NPR and police excesses against the student protesters entered its third day on Tuesday. The sit-in at Mansoor Ali Park began as a small gathering on Sunday. It has now turned into a full-fledged agitation against the governments actions, which are not in the countrys interest, said Saira Ahmed, a protester.',\n",
       " 'China, acting on behalf of Pakistan, is pushing for a discussion on Kashmir at the United Nations Security Councils closed door meet later this evening, the third such attempt over the last six months.A similar effort by China had been thwarted just a month ago when France and other permanent members of the Security Council had then persuaded Beijing to withdraw its note to seek a meeting on Kashmir on the grounds that the body was not the best forum to discuss the issue.French diplomatic sources confirmed that a UNSC member had proposed to raise the issue of Kashmir again.Frances position has not changed and is very clear: the Kashmir issue must be settled bilaterally  as we have stated on several occasions and will continue to reiterate to our partners on the United Nations Security Council, a French diplomatic source said.China, which claims the Ladakh region, has opposed the reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories after the Centre last year abrogated Article 370 that gave special status to the former state. India maintains that the change in Jammu and Kashmir is an internal matter that dont affect external boundaries.Last week, French president Emmanuel Macron discussed the Kashmir issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying Paris continues to track developments in the region closely.',\n",

He uses this base to push Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) into the Indian territory via the porous Indo-Nepal border and operates with the help of a few officials at the Pakistan embassy in Kathmandu.The Mumbai police had arrested Lakdawala from Patna on January 8.Lakdawala further told the top officials at the Crime Branch about Dawood Ibrahims two addresses in Karachi - 6A, Khayaban Tanzim Phase-5, Defence Housing Area, Karachi and D-13, Block 4, Clifton, Karachi.Currently in police remand, he has also revealed the addresses of Dawood\\'s brother Anees Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel, who also reside in Karachis Defence Housing Area.\"Officials of other agencies are also questioning Lakdawala.

The business is now being managed by Chhota Shakeel.News agency IANS has mentioned sources as saying that Ejaz Lakdawala, who parted ways with Dawood Ibrahim after the serial blasts in Mumbai in 1993, had tried to eliminate the D-Company boss around 10 years ago.The operation, led by Chhota Rajan\\'s sharpshooter Vicky Malhotra, was to be carried out at the funeral of Dawood\\'s daughter Maria in Karachi. However, it could not happen because Dawood did not attend the funeral procession.Later, Lakdawala set up his own gang, somewhere in Cambodia, owing to a dispute with Rajan over some payment issue.A fake passport being used by his daughter, Soniya Lakdawala, to flee from India helped in the arrest of Ejaz Lakdawala.',\n",

       " 'Chinese health authorities, for the first time, have said it is possible that the new coronavirus which has sparked fears of an outbreak as hundreds of millions begin travelling in China and outside for the upcoming Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays could be passed through human contact but the risk of person-to-person transmission is low.At least one person has been killed and dozens infected by the new virus, which can cause respiratory illness and has influenza-type symptoms.The announcement from the health authorities from Wuhan city in central Chinas Hubei province came after it was confirmed that an infected person who travelled to Thailand was from Wuhan and undergoing treatment in a Thai hospital near Bangkok.At least three other Chinese travellers from Wuhan were diagnosed with fever in Thailand but they were found not to have been infected with the new coronavirus.On Tuesday, the Geneva-based World Health Organisation (WHO) also said that there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in China within families and that the possibility of a wider outbreak could not be ruled out.Wuhans health commission told Chinese state media that people in close contact with the traveller were under medical observation but no symptom of the disease had been found in them yet.The commission said that they found no evidence that the new coronavirus can be passed on via people, but they cannot completely rule out the possibility. However, such risk is low, and further research is underway, a state media report said.Of the 41 people infected with the virus, one is a married couple.A married couple was among the confirmed cases. The husband had been working at the seafood market where the virus was first detected, while the wife wasnt exposed to it in the market, said the Wuhan health commission official.The initial big clue to this outbreak, detected in December, that most patients had exposure to a single seafood and live animal market in Wuhan.Reports said all the infected fell ill between December 8 and January 2.The Wuhan health commission also that among the 41 cases, most were men and the majority had been exposed to the seafood market.Their preliminary symptoms included fever and coughing. Elderly people with other health issues were likely to have more serious effects if they became infected.Close contacts of the confirmed infected people will be put under close observation for 14 days; and if they show any symptoms, they will be sent to hospital for further examination, said the commission.The death of a patient on January 11 coincided with the beginning of Chinas annual travel rush on Friday for the CNY holidays comprising some three billion trips in 2020.Over the next 40 days, more than half-billion people will pack into trains, buses and passenger aircraft to travel home and elsewhere amid the lurking fear of the pneumonia outbreak - and whether the passengers will become vectors for the disease.According to WHO, coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).',\n",

This would be the second bank strike this month, after the first one was observed along with Bharat Bandh on January 8.The timing of this bank strike is important because it coincides with Budget day. The Economic Survey will be presented on January 31 while on February 1 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her second Budget. Since February 1 is the first Saturday of the month, all commercial banks are supposed to be open on the Budget day. Even stock exchanges have decided to open, especially for Budget.Representatives of 9 constituents of the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU)  held a bipartite talks on Monday with the IBA in which several wage-related demands were turned down. Bank unions are demanding a 20% hike on payslip components, merger of special allowance with basic pay and a uniform 5-day work week. Other demands include scrapping of New Pension Scheme, improvement in family pension and defined working hours for officers.\"After discussing the financial offers of IBA amongst the constituents, UFBU expressed its inability to accept the same. Thereafter UFBU meeting was held as scheduled and decisions were taken to launch agitations and Strike actions,\" UFBU general secretary Debasish Basu Chaudhury said.UFBU, which represents nine trade unions, has threatened to hold another three-day strike from March 11-13, to be followed by an indefinite strike from April 1 if their demands of pay hike are not met.Besides wage related issues, bank unions have been protesting against the Narendra Modi government for merging several PSU banks. The January 8 bank strike was successful in several parts of the country as scores of bank employees abstained from work.',\n",

Sikhs meet the criteria for representation in the US Census as a distinct ethnic group and have a distinct unified appearance, culture, language, food and history.The United Sikhs has advocated for the separate coding for more than two decades and filed commentary with the US Federal Register advocating for Sikhs to be added as an ethnic group, in large part, so that action can be taken to address major Sikh issues such as bullying, intimidation and hate crimes against the community.With the 2020 census approaching, many historically undercoded communities will be at-risk for being under-counted and under-served, said Ruben Singh, United Sikhs Census Manager  We look forward to collaborating with our census partners and other Sikh organisations and institutions to address the unanticipated challenges of the 2020 Census, he said.Meanwhile, the Sikh Coalition has partnered with the Census Bureau for the 2020 census. This is because Sikhs have traditionally been a hard to count population in the United States, said Satjeet Kaur, Sikh Coalition executive director.Our community matters, and we want to make sure that Sikh families are appropriately counted and accurately resourced wherever they are across our country, she said.

       " 'AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army said on Tuesday Israeli jets attacked the main T4 air base in Homs province, saying its air defences downed several missiles in strikes that caused only material damage. An army spokesman told state media that four Israeli missiles did reach the base, but said air defences intercepted several others.  State television earlier did not say who was behind the attack on the major air base, which Israel accuses of hosting an Iranian military presence and has attacked several times in recent years. The Israeli airforce conducted new aerial aggression and immediately our air defences confronted the enemy missiles, an army statement said. The Syrian army statement said the Israeli war jets flew from Tanf, to the southeast, where the United States has set up a base near the Iraqi-Jordanian border.  Tanf lies on the strategic Damascus-Baghdad highway, a major supply route for Iranian weapons into Syria. This makes the base a bulwark against Iran and part of a larger U.S. campaign against Iranian influence in Iraq and Syria. Israel has repeatedly bombed Iranian backed militia targets in Syria, saying its goal was to end Tehrans military presence  which Western intelligence sources say has expanded in recent years in the war-torn country. The Israel Defence Force did not immediately comment on the attack. Tuesdays strikes are the first which Syria accused Israel of undertaking since the United States killed Irans most powerful military commander in a drone strike on Jan. 3, sparking one of the biggest escalations between Tehran and Washington since 1979.  Irans proxy militias led by Lebanons Hezbollah now hold sway in vast areas in eastern and southern Syria and northwest as well as several suburbs around the capital.  They have also entrenched themselves in the strategically located border town of AlbuKamal on the Euphrates river in Deir Zor district in eastern Syria near the border with Iraq where Iraqi Shiite paramilitary groups have a strong foothold. Western intelligence sources say Israel has been behind several strikes against Iranian assets in the border area in recent weeks. The Iraqi side of the border had seen the deployment in large numbers of Iran-allied Iraqi Shiite militias who now de facto control large stretches of the frontier, with posts not far from military bases housing U.S. troops. The U.S. military struck Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group in areas in Iraq and Syria along the border area at the end of last month in what U.S. officials said was a response to escalating provocations from Iran. Israel in the past has said Iran uses the T4 base to transfer weapons to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia group with which it fought a deadly month-long war in 2006. Western intelligence sources say it has also been used as a base for Irans Revolutionary Guards. Israel, which previously has rarely acknowledged strikes in Syria, has become more vocal in pledging it will do what is needed to thwart the entrenchment of Iranian forces or arms transfers to Hezbollah.

       " 'Yamaha Music Japan has cautioned against people mimicking Carlos Ghosn by cramming themselves into its large boxes for musical instruments and equipment, saying that copycat attempts could lead to unfortunate accidents.The Japanese firms warning in a recent tweet was in response to social media posts on playing Ghosn  an allusion to reports that the former auto tycoon fled Japan last month inside a large case intended for musical instruments.We wont mention the reason, but there have been many tweets about climbing inside large musical instrument cases. A warning after any unfortunate accident would be too late, so we ask everyone not to try it, said Yamaha Wind Stream, the companys account for information on wind instruments.In one photograph, a young woman is curled up inside a padded green harp case, while another post appeared to show somebody standing in a double bass gig bag.Ghosn was arrested in November 2018 and later charged with financial misconduct and breach of trust while head of Nissan. He denies the charges and sent shockwaves around the world late last month when he fled Japan to Lebanon while out on bail.While Ghosn declined to explain how he had escaped at a press conference last week, reports suggest he walked out of his residence in Tokyo before boarding a bullet train to Osaka. Helped by private security operatives, he is is believed to have evaded detection at Kansai international airport by hiding inside a speaker box that was too big to fit through the airports X-ray scanner.Ghosn, 65, took a private jet to Istanbul and then on to Lebanon, where he spent part of his childhood. A large case for audio equipment was later found at the back of the jets cabin. The Wall Street Journal reported that holes had been drilled into the container to ensure the fugitive businessman could breathe.Authorities in Japan, where Ghosn spent more than 120 days in detention before being released on bail, have vowed to pursue him and his wife, Carole. Lebanon, however, does not have an extradition agreement with Japan.Yamaha, which makes instruments and equipment ranging from pianos and double basses to drums and heavy-duty speakers, thanked people for their response to its initial post, which has been retweeted more than 54,000 times and liked more than 86,000 times.And it reminded them that their range of cases were not intended to hold humans.',\n",

The Delhi-born cricketer was dismissed on the same delivery and has since been observed closely by the doctors.The rest of the members of the Indian team are ready to travel to Rajkot where the second ODI of the 3-match series will take place in a couple of days. Pant, however, is still in line for a return and will be sent to Rajkot separately if he manages to fully recover from the concussion.The 22-year-old was one of the brightest players for the team with the bat at Wankhede as he scored 28 runs from 33 balls to put up a brave fight amid the catastrophic middle-order collapse that the hosts witnessed.The Men in Blue would hope to have Rishbh fit and firing in the second ODI as they look to make a comeback to level the series 1-1 having suffered an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat against Aaron Finch & Co. in the series opener.In a case where Pant fails to fully recover, it would be interesting to see if the Indian team persists with Rahul behind the stumps or call in a replacement in the form of Sanju Samson.\",\n",

       " 'Mumbai: Bajaj Auto Ltds managing director Rajiv Bajaj on Tuesday said that over-regulation is the single most inimical factor behind the demand downturn in the two-wheeler industry today. He was referring to the series of norms that have been introduced by the government over the past 18 months that have led to the increase in vehicle costs.The over-regulation is killing the industry. This started in September 2018 when insurance costs went up. Several thousands of rupees of insurance cost were imposed on every typical two-wheeler customer,\" Bajaj said on the sidelines of the launch of electric Chetak scooter in Mumbai on Tuesday.In AugustSeptember 2018, a Supreme Court order made a three-year third party insurance cover for cars and five-year third-party insurance cover for two-wheelers mandatory, thereby resulting into a steep hike in the vehicles on-road costs for the consumers. In April 2019, this was later met with compulsory safety norms wherein combi-braking system (CBS) was introduced in all two-wheelers up to 125 cc and anti-lock braking system (ABS) in all models above 125 cc.Compulsory introduction of ABS resulted in increasing the prices by  8,000 10,000. Under BS-VI norms, you have already seen that the prices have gone up by 7,00018,000. If another 8,00010,000 extra is imposed on the consumers, this means that in one-and-half-year period, the common mans two-wheeler will see price hike of 30%. To me this is the hard, tangible issue on the ground. Nobodys wallet is 30% bigger in 18 months time,\" said Bajaj slamming the government.Does the government has the humility to reflect and roll back some of this? While for the electric vehicles, they have brought down the GST to 5%, the petrol / diesel vehicles continue to see 28%. Can they at least bring it down to 18%, at least for a while? Can they for some time absorb the hit (price rise) that will come under BSVI?,\" he asked, commenting further.He also said that a vehicle manufacturer struggles to improve productivity and reduce costs to keep price increases as close as possible to zero to avoid any price increase for end consumers.On the intent to control air pollution and mandating the BS VI emission norms, he said getting rid of old vehicles through a suitable mechanism would have been much more effective solution than squeezing out the last little bit of emissions from the BS-IV vehicles\".',\n",
       " 'Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Tuesday threatened to resign after a seer belonging to the Panchamsali sect of Lingayats demanded that Murugesh Nirani, a BJP MLA, be inducted into the cabinet failing which he would face the wrath of the community. At an event of the Panchamsali sect in Harihar, Swami Vachanand addressing the thousands gathered with the CM seated next to him said Murugesh Nirani has stood with you like a rock. Induct him into the cabinet, otherwise the Panchamsali Lingayats will abandon their support to you. An agitated Yediyurappa immediately got up and was heard telling the Swami, Dont threaten me. You can advise but dont threaten. The Swami, however, insisted that his community was demanding justice. Community and BJP leaders including home minister Basvraj Bommai tried to mollifying the CM. Later addressing the audience, Yediyurappa said, 17 MLAs including some ministers made sacrifices and are in Vanvas. Either co-operate with me in helping complete remaining three years of my term successfully, otherwise I will resign because I am not addicted to power.Though the BJP now has a full majority of 117 seats in a 225 member assembly (including a nominated member), after the party swept bypolls winning 12 of the 15 seats, Yediyurappa has been struggling to expand his cabinet. The BJP high command is yet to green light Yeddyurappas election promise to induct all the 11 rebel MLAs who switched from Congress and JD (S) into the cabinet. Murugesh Nirani speaking to reporters later said, Yeddyurappa is like a father to us. Even if he says something it will be in our interest only. He also expressed confidence that the BJP government would complete its full term.Yediyurappa earlier had said that he would consult BJP President Amit Shah who will be in the state on January 18 to address a pro-CAA rally and then expand the cabinet. Congress Spokesperson V S Ugrappa taunted the CM saying, Yeddyurappa is not a tiger but a rat. He is not able to even get even an audience with Modi. After promising to induct the rebel MLAs within 24 hours of winning, he hasnt been able to do anything. Wouldnt be surprised if he resigns due to political frustration and inability to have his way.Political analyst Manjunath said the CMs outburst indicated his frustration with his partys high command and his inability to honour the promise he made to the MLAs who crossed over from the opposition. While he is seen as the undisputed and tallest leader among Lingayats, he would not have expected this kind of public pressure being applied by a seer of his own community, which probably would have lead to this outburst. It is also his way of pressurising the BJP party high command into taking a decision on cabinet expansion.',\n",

It did not force any evacuations.Thats a great sign, Cornell said.All the fuel evaporated very quickly and nothing flammable remained in the air or on the ground, he said.People were treated with soap and water, the fire inspector Henry Narvaez said.Shortly after takeoff, Delta Air Lines flight 89 to Shanghai experienced an engine issue requiring the aircraft to return quickly to LAX. The aircraft landed safely after release of fuel, which was required as part of normal procedure to reach a safe landing weight, the company said in a statement. The airline did not release details about the engine problem.The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating.There are special fuel-dumping procedures for aircraft operating into and out of any major US airport, the FAA said in a statement. These procedures call for fuel to be dumped over designated unpopulated areas, typically at higher altitudes so the fuel atomizes and disperses before it reaches the ground.The FlightAware websites flight track showed the jet took off over the ocean and made an immediate right turn toward land and circled back over southern California to approach the airport from the east.Delta said it was in touch with the airport and fire department and shared concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children.The Los Angeles unified school district said its Park Avenue Elementary campus in Cudahy and 93rd Street Elementary had direct impacts from the fuel.Cornell said 31 children and adults were affected at Park Avenue, and 12 at 93rd Street. The rest of those affected were at other schools.The school district said in a statement that paramedics were immediately called to treat anyone complaining of skin irritation or breathing problems and that its environmental health and safety office also responded.Diego Martinez, a Park Avenue sixth-grader, said he and his classmates were outside for physical education class when they saw the airplane flying low overhead.It was very close, he said. Shortly afterwards the air filled with the pungent odor of fuel. It was very strong, the odor, the 12-year-old said.Diego was not doused but some of his friends complained that their skin was itching.Some teachers at Park Avenue had headaches from the smell, said Antonio Buenabad, area representative for the United Teachers Los Angeles union.They were anxious to get home and shower because the stench was very strong, he said of the teachers.A high school was also affected, but no one was treated there.',\n",
       " 'German police said Tuesday they were investigating after a man dressed as Adolf Hitler rode around a weekend festival in a motorbike sidecar, although he provoked more amusement than outrage -- including from a local policeman.When people dress up as Adolf Hitler, an investigation is always necessary, a spokesman for Saxony police had explained to news agency DPA on Monday.The fake Fuehrer appeared at a classic motorcycle gathering in Augustusburg, near Chemnitz, and was seen in videos of the event posted online.He sported a toothbrush moustache and was seated in the sidecar of a bike driven by a man dressed as a 1940s-era soldier, complete with World War II-style helmet.In the video people are heard laughing as the pair pass by and a policeman guarding the event pulls out his phone with a smile to take photos.The officer could now face consequences for his failure to step in.We would have expected our colleague to put a stop to all this without the least hesitation, the Saxony police spokesman said.Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer also condemned the Hitler pantomime.Dressing up as a mass murderer is more than just bad taste, he tweeted. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable and shouldnt be repeated.The officer seen laughing at the impersonator was summoned for a meeting with his superiors and has acknowledged his misconduct, a spokesman for the local Chemnitz police told AFP on Tuesday.He could still face disciplinary action depending on the outcome of the prosecutors investigation into the incident.The prosecutors are considering whether the Hitler stunt constitutes a possible public order violation, or even an act of incitement to hatred.Around 1,800 motorcyclists and 7,500 visitors took part in the weekend classic bike festival in Saxony, a region in former communist East Germany that has made headlines for far-right and neo-Nazi activities in recent years.',\n",

       " 'Virat Kohli\\'s batting position sparked a debate in the Indian cricket fraternity following India\\'s 10-wicket loss at the hands of Australia in the Mumbai ODI on Tuesday (January 14). While India slipped from 134 for 1 to be dismissed for a moderate 255 all-out in 49.1 overs, many believed skipper Kohli couldn\\'t play freely by coming out to bat at No. 4 in the 28th over.As a result, Aaron Finch and David Warner\\'s respective tons and an unbeaten 258-run opening stand propelled the visitors to a big win to kick off the series on a high. However, another talking point of the series opener became when Kohli got dismissed by leg spinner Adam Zampa for the fourth time since early 2019.Zampa had dominated Kohli even during Australia\\'s last visit to India, where they came from 0-2 to claim the five ODIs by 3-2.Hence, former skipper Steve Waugh believes Kohli needs to give more respect to Zampa.On the commentary for Fox Cricket on Tuesday, Waugh said, \"I just dont think hes showing Zampa enough respect and he paid the price.\"Spinners who have dismissed Kohli the most number of times in ODIs:Adam Zampa* (4)Suraj Randiv (4)Graeme Swann (4)In the run-up to the three ODIs, Kohli had pointed out, \"He was probably one bowler, who had more belief than others (on the 2019 tour) I felt. Throughout the game, even when he was hit for boundaries, he kept coming at the batsmen and try and get them out, which I think is important for a wrist-spinner. And his mindset was a stand out for them in the last series.He\\'s still skillful enough to make breakthroughs also, so we have to be respectful but at the same time have belief in our game to be able to play well against them.\" However, Waugh seems to believe Kohli has to rework his batting against Zampa.Kohli smashed the leggie for a six before handing him a tough catch, of his own bowling, to fall for 16 while coming out at No. 4. Later in the evening, Indian bowlers remained clueless to not even earn a single wicket as Australia thrashed India by 10 wickets to chase down 256 in just 37.4 overs.The penultimate tie will be held in Rajkot on Friday (January 17).',\n",
       " 'A groundbreaking brain-scanning technique has uncovered evidence that suggests schizophrenia is linked to a loss of connections between brain cells.Scientists had previously suspected a breakdown in the connections between neurons played a role in the condition, based on postmortem studies. The latest research, the first to find evidence for this in the brains of living people, could pave the way for new and better treatment.Prof Oliver Howes from the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Imperial College London and Kings College London, who led the study, said: Our current treatments for schizophrenia target only one aspect of the disease: the psychotic symptoms. But the debilitating cognitive symptoms, such as loss of abilities to plan and remember, often cause much more long-term disability and theres no treatment for them at the moment.Howes believes the loss of connections, known as synapses, between brain cells, could be responsible for this broader array of symptoms.The study, published in Nature Communications, focused on measuring a protein found in synapses called SV2A, which has been shown to be a good marker of the overall density of connections in the brain.They used a tracer that binds to the protein and which emits a signal that can be picked up by a PET brain scan, which provided an indirect measure of the density of connections. The team scanned 18 adults with schizophrenia and compared them with 18 people without the condition.They found that levels of SV2A were significantly lower in the front of the brain  the region involved in planning  in people with schizophrenia.The real advance is we have something that we can see in living patients and begin to track it and see whether its happening early in the illness, Howes said.The researchers have also found preliminary evidence that the level of the protein is linked to cognitive performance in people with schizophrenia.Howes and colleagues are also running a clinical trial, which is expected to be completed next year, that aims to prevent the loss of brain connections in patients.',\n",
       " 'Britain, France and Germany have kickstarted a process that could lead to United Nations sanctions being reimposed on Iran and the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal, after triggering the deals dispute resolution mechanism.Officials described the move as one taken more in sorrow than anger and said it was in part prompted by fears Iran might be less than a year away from possessing the capacity to develop a nuclear bomb.Concern was most acute that Iran will be learning about centrifuge enrichment in an irreversible way. The concern is they are going to learn something that it is not possible for them to unlearn, one senior official said.The three nations said they rejected Tehrans argument that Iran was justified in violating the deal because the United States broke the 2015 agreement by pulling out unilaterally in 2018.We have therefore been left with no choice, given Irans actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments, the countries said in a joint statement. They added the move did not mean the EU was joining the Trump administrations campaign of maximum economic pressure on Iran.The decision was taken in principle before Christmas by the three European powers, and not prompted by the recent Iranian attack on US bases in Iraq, or the Iranians accidental downing of the Ukrainian airliner.The Iranian foreign ministry issued a relatively mild response saying: If Europeans, instead of keeping to their commitments and making Iran benefit from the lifting of the sanctions, misuse the dispute resolution mechanism, theyll need to be prepared for the consequences that they have been informed about earlier.The remarks seemed designed to be a warning that Europe should not go through the gears of the dispute mechanism quickly, something officials insist they will not do.Germanys foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said the three European countries could no longer leave the growing Iranian violations of the nuclear agreement unanswered.Our goal is clear: we want to preserve the accord and come to a diplomatic solution within the agreement, he said. We call on Iran to participate constructively in the negotiation process that is now beginning.Irans foreign ministry warned of a serious and strong response. Foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi added, however, that Iran was fully ready to answer any good will and constructive effort that preserves the deal.Under the dispute resolution mechanism, countries have 30 days to resolve their problem, though that can be extended. If it cannot be solved, the matter could be brought before the UN security council and could then result in the snapback of sanctions that had been lifted under the deal.Officials said the practical impact of reimposed sanctions would be low due to the swingeing nature of existing US sanctions. It would, however, represent a severe blow to the cause of multilateral nuclear non-proliferation.A western diplomat said: This allows us to buy time whilemaking clear to Iran that they cannot continue on this path of non-compliance with no consequences.Donald Trump has been pressing Europe to leave the nuclear deal ever since he unilaterally took the US out of deal in May 2018. In response, Iran has rolled back its commitments in stages to try and pressure the other countries involved to provide economic incentives to offset the American sanctions, but efforts from them so far have been insufficient.The White House will be delighted that its sustained pressure has paid off. There is little expectation that Iran will respond to the EUs move by reversing the steps it has already taken, especially on nuclear research and development.In his strongest call yet from Europe for a new agreement to replace the 2015 deal, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the way forward was to agree what he called a Trump deal.If were going to get rid of it, lets replace it and lets replace it with the Trump deal  President Trump is a great dealmaker, by his own account, he said.The UKs foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, tried to finesse Johnsons call by saying the existing deal was the best way to rein in Irans nuclear ambitions, but this did not preclude a search for a wider more ambitious deal covering Irans ballistic missiles and its regional behaviour. UK officials argue any such deal would require the US to suspend sanctions for negotiations to start, something Trump rejects.Iran has taken its five successive steps away from the deal because it says the EU has not fulfilled its commitment to boost trade. The US has imposed extra-territorial sanctions making it nearly impossible for European firms to trade with Iran and not risk swingeing US fines. A mechanism designed to circumvent the sanctions set up by the EU has so far failed to facilitate a single transaction between European firms and Iran.European diplomats stressed the move was not being taken to reimpose sanctions, but to try to find some way to press Iran to come back into compliance with the deal. Josep Borrell, the EUs foreign affairs high representative, even went so far as to say that preserving the nuclear deal is more important than ever.Iran says it no longer feels bound to comply with aspects of the deal except allowing UN inspectors into its sites.The EU, following long talks with Russia and China about its plan, said it was hopeful that Tehran would not react by banning the UN inspectors.European diplomats remain sceptical that Trumps policy of maximum economic pressure will persuade Iran to renegotiate the deal, and fear it will instead strengthen the position of hardliners in Tehran. The street protests in Tehran have not changed that EU judgment. ',\n",
       " 'Taiwans president Tsai Ing-wen has called on China to face reality and review its current policy toward the de facto nation that Beijing claims is part of its territory.Tsai, who won re-election in a landslide victory on Saturday, told reporters: We hope China can thoroughly understand the opinion and will expressed by Taiwanese people in this election and review their current policies.The presidents comments come days after Chinas top diplomat said that unification with China was a historical inevitability and that anyone who opposed it would stink for 10,000 years, an idiom to mean someone will go down in infamy.China has repeatedly said that it will bring Taiwan under its authority by any means necessary, including force. Analysts believe Chinese leader Xi Jinping aims to achieve that by 2049, the deadline for the country to achieve its great rejuvenation.Taiwan was ruled for more than three decades by the nationalist army, the Kuomintang, which fled to the island in 1949 after being defeated by the Chinese communist party and created a rival government, the Republic of China, better known today as Taiwan. It has since transformed into a multi-party democracy, under a government and political system completely separate from Chinas.The election of a candidate who campaigned heavily on promises to not allow Taiwan to become another Hong Kong has been widely seen as a rebuke to Chinas efforts to intimidate and persuade Taiwan citizens to support unification.Under Tsais first term, Beijing severed a dialogue mechanism with Taiwan and has sought to isolate it diplomatically. In a show of strength, China sailed its new aircraft carrier through the Taiwan strait twice in the run up to the election.Tsai opposes unification but has never said that she would formally declare Taiwans independence, which would provoke Beijing.We dont have a need to declare ourselves an independent state, Tsai told the BBC. We are an independent country already and we call ourselves the Republic of China, Taiwan.Tsai said the election served as a very strong message from the people of Taiwan.They dont like the idea of being threatened all the time. We are a successful democracy  We deserve respect from China, she said. We have a separate identity and were a country of our own.Beijing has refused to deal directly with Tsai on the grounds that she has not, like her predecessor, accepted the so-called 1992 consensus which says that Taiwan and China are part of one China. The vague agreement leaves it up to each side to interpret the definition of one China.Tsai said that before dialogue can be re-opened, Beijing must review its current approach.

       " 'Maninder Singh, who was being hunted by Chandigarh Police for killing a nurse at a hotel around New Years Eve, confessed to his crime on live television here on Tuesday. A murder convict currently out on bail, he also confessed to the previous crime committed in Karnal in 2010, even as he had earlier filed a review petition in the high court.As soon as they got the information, cops rushed to the office of the Punjabi news channel in the Industrial Area, Phase 2, and arrested the 31-year-old while the programme was still being telecast from the TV studio. Sarabjit Kaur, 27, was found lying on the bed with her throat slit, in room number 301 at Hotel Sky, also in the Industrial Area, Phase 2, on the afternoon of January 1. She had checked into the hotel along with Maninder on December 30. CCTV footage showed Maninder leaving the hotel the same evening. The murder came to light when the hotel staff went to inquire about their check-out timings, as the couple had made the booking for just two days.Sarabjit, who belonged to Sangrur and had previously worked at a private hospital in Mohali, had recently got selected as a nurse at the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bathinda. Her training was to commence at the PGIMER in a few days.Maninder used to work as a driver at a factory in the Industrial Area, Phase 1, till about three months back. The two were in a relationship and had visited the hotel a number of times, police had claimed.I killed her because she was having an affair with her sister-in-laws brother, said Maninder, during his interview in the TV studio.  Maninder said the man in question had sent her a message on her mobile phone, stating that he was leaving for Kuwait andshe should meet him before his departure. I saw the messages on Sarabjits phone and asked her about him. She said they were supposed to get married, but later her family decided that they would first marry Sarabjits elder brother. After this, I choked her and then killed her with a knife, said Maninder.During the interview, Maninder claimed everything was fine between the couple and they had even visited Amritsar, although Sarabjits family had refused to his marriage proposal.Her family told me that as their daughter has a government job and I am jobless, they couldnt marry her to me. The second reason was our caste. I regret what I did, he said. In fact, after being arrested, Maninder reportedly told police that he and Sarabjit were planning to elope and he had also taken a loan from bank.Haryana Police had arrested Maninder for killing a woman, with whom he had a relationship, in Karnal back in 2010. He was later convicted, following which he had challenged the order in the Punjab and Haryana high court. He was presently out on bail. Confessing to that crime as well, Maninder said: I killed Renu during a fight at Karna Lake in Karnal, where she had gone for her training. She was also having an affair with a man from Uttar Pradesh. According to the channel officials, Maninder reached their office around 6pm and contacted a cameraman who was shooting a news video. He told the staffer about his case and said that he wanted to surrender as police have held his parents captive. While he was taken to the TV studio, the management informed the Sector 31 police station.During the interview, Maninder said that before leaving his house last month, he had lied to his parents that he was going to Ludhiana as he had got a job.After committing the crime, he had been on the move  staying in Bathinda, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur, Patiala, Sangrur and Jalandhar  to avoid being traced, said police. His Hyundai i20 car, which was abandoned in Patiala, was recovered two days ago, said an investigating official.Maninder is the youngest of three siblings. His father is a carpenter and his two elder sisters are married. The accused has studied till Class 12 at Government Senior Secondary School in Sector 27.Even as police had been claiming that Maninder fled to Punjab or Madhya Pradesh after changing his baptised Sikh look, he appeared on TV with a flowing beard and turban.

       " 'Elizabeth Warren has said Bernie Sanders told her during a private meeting that he did not believe a woman could beat Donald Trump in 2020, a version of events that Sanders vehemently denies. In a statement issued on Monday evening, Warren offered her recollections of their conversation, a one-on-one discussion which took place in Washington at the end of 2018, when each senator was laying the groundwork for a presidential run.Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate, Warren said in a statement on Monday evening, detailing her account of the meeting. I thought a woman could win; he disagreed. I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry.The back-and-forth represents a dramatic break for the leading progressive presidential hopefuls after a months-long truce. The escalating bitterness comes at a pivotal moment for both candidates, just three weeks before voting begins in Iowa and a day before Tuesdays Democratic debate, in Des Moines. At the debate, the candidates will almost certainly be asked to clarify their different interpretations of the meeting.Sanders has denied the story, reported by CNN on Monday.In a statement, Sanders said it would be ludicrous to believe that he would have made such a comment and accused members of Warrens staff, who werent present for the one-on-one conversation, of lying about what happened.What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could, he said.Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3m votes in 2016, he added, referring to Clintons haul of the popular vote in contrast to the electoral college result.Warrens campaign remained silent for most of Monday in the wake of the CNN report. Faiz Shakir, Sanders campaign manager, had called on Warren to address the matter publicly.I know what she would say: that it is not true, that it is a lie, Shakir told CNN.MORE: I asked @fshakir if we need to hear directly from @eWarren as to what happened in the conversation.His response: We need to hear from her directly, but I know what she would say that it is not true that it is a lie. pic.twitter.com/Gf1LWtoxvXDuring the December 2018 meeting, Warren told Sanders she was planning to run for president and the senators, who consider each other friends, agreed that they would avoid attacking one another in the ensuing battle for the partys nomination so as not to further divide the progressive movement.While friction have been building for weeks between the campaigns and their supporters, the candidates had so far refused to go after each other directly.In recent months, Sanders has gained momentum as Warren declined from her summer high. But the race remains remarkably fluid, with Sanders and Warren locked in a tight race in Iowa. The latest Des Moines Register and CNN poll placed Sanders and Warren atop the field in Iowa, with Sanders leading the pack.Tensions built over the weekend, when Politico reported that Sanders campaign was instructing volunteers to tell voters wavering between the two progressive candidates that Warrens popularity was limited to highly educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what and that she was bringing no new bases into the Democratic party.Responding to the leaked script, Warren told reporters that she was disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me. In a fundraising email, her campaign asked supporters to respond if the Bernie campaigns description rang false to you, too.For his part, Sanders insisted he had never said a negative word about Warren, who he called a friend. He added both campaigns have hundreds of employees, who sometimes say things that they shouldnt.Sanders has long been skeptical of the Democratic partys emphasis on identity politics but the issue has been particularly fraught in a field shaped by younger and more diverse candidates.In the December debate, Sanders was asked to respond to Barack Obamas comments that the world would be a better place if there were more female heads of state and that many problems are caused by old men not getting out of the way.Sanders quipped that he was not only old but white, too. Then he joked that it might be self-serving but he disagreed with the former president.The issue is where power resides in America, he said. And its not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy. We have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians.What started as the most racially diverse and female primary field in history has shifted dramatically. On Tuesday, no candidates of color will be on the debate stage. All of the leading candidates are white, and only one is a woman.The fields dissipating diversity was underscored on Monday by the departure of Cory Booker, who is African American, just over a week after Julin Castro, the only Latino presidential candidate, ended his campaign.The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, the only other female candidate who will be on the debate stage on Tuesday night, has been increasingly vocal about the role of sexism and double standards in presidential politics.Last month, she wondered aloud on the debate stage whether a female candidate with as little experience as Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would have qualified.There is a lot of talk today about if a woman can beat Donald Trump, Klobuchar wrote on Twitter, responding to the CNN report. As I said on the debate stage, Nancy Pelosi does it every day.',\n",

Phoenix turned the story of a mentally unstable loner and failed comedian Arthur Fleck, who picks violence to find calmness in his life, into a blockbuster.  I feel honoured and humbled to have been nominated by my fellow actors. The Academys encouragement helped ignite and sustain my career and I am incredibly grateful for that support. Id like to also congratulate my fellow nominees for being recognised for their inspiring performances that have enriched our art form,  Phoenix said. Todd Phillips Joker, an origin story about superhero Batmans biggest enemy Joker, got 11 nods, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. Other categories are: Cinematography, Adapted Screenplay, Costume Design, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, Original Score, Film Editing and Make-up and Hairstyling.  Joker began as an idea, an experiment really -- take an indie approach to a studio film by inverting it into a character study to reflect the world around us? Explore what were seeing and feeling in society, from the lack of empathy to the effects of the absence of love. I am deeply honoured by the overwhelming recognition of the Academy, and I want to thank the genius that is Joaquin Phoenix, and all my incredible collaborators. We are beyond humbled that our peers in the film-making community have embraced the film and its message, Phillips said. The Warner Bros Pictures project has become the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, and has crossed the $ 1 billion mark at the worldwide box office. In fact, the impact is deep as it has sparked conversation around mental health. A follow-up to film is also in the works. Joker composer Hildur Guonadottir earned her first Oscar nomination, and became one of only seven women in the award shows history to be nominated for Best Original Score.Im truly honoured and proud to be recognised with an Academy Award nomination for my work on Joker. Being invited into this illustrious group of talent and getting to take part in telling this story means the world to me. Todd Phillips is a master of his craft and it was wonderful to experience how he trusts and empowers his collaborators so they can deliver their best work possible.  We see that in the way every element of the film has its space to shine, because he gives each element real weight. The brightest shining of those of course being Joaquin Phoenixs performance, which was simply otherworldly. Im grateful for having been invited on this journey of a lifetime with them and I congratulate all of my fellow nominees on their nominations,  Guonadottir said.

I realised however, after Veer-Zara (2004), that the significance of a role is not just about being glamorous. What you give to a role is whats integral to the story.

Minutes later, it exploded and crashed.The footage was shot from a rooftop in Bidkaneh, a village four miles from an Iranian military site, the Times said.Hundreds of angry protesters, most of them students, have taken to the streets in the wake of the tragedy, chanting slogans against the Islamic republic.Iran announced its first arrests over the accidental shooting on Tuesday, without naming who or how many people had been detained.

       " 'In a first since the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) triggered a series of protest, including a few violent ones, the state police have enforced prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Act (CrPC) to stop the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from holding two back-to-back rallies since Sunday.Cases have also been registered against BJP leaders for violating the orders. Both incidents have taken place in the north Bengal region where the BJP wrested all the Lok Sabha seats from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in 2019, taking the partys tally from two seats in Bengal to 18. Of the states 42 Lok Sabha seats, TMC won 22, mostly in south Bengal. On January 12, BJP Bengal unit general secretary Sayantan Basu and the partys Cooch Behar district unit president Malati Rava Ray were stopped on their way to the districts Sitalkuchi where they were scheduled to hold a pro-CAA rally that the BJP had christened Abhinandan Yatra.We were told by the administration that restrictions under Section 144 had been imposed in anticipation of unrest. We went ahead and held a meeting where we were stopped. We will move the Calcutta high court against this tactics of the government. The TMC cannot muffle us. They are scared of the BJP and possibly hallucinate that our presence will lead to some kind of war, said Basu.On Monday, while preparations were on for another Abhinandan Yatra in the Malgalpur area of adjacent South Dinajpur district, Basu and Bengal BJP Yuva Morcha (youth front) president Debjit Sarkar were stopped by police and told that people were not allowed to assemble as Section 144 was in force.A huge crowd had already assembled. The administration passed the order after we arrived. Nobody said a word since morning when a dais was set up, chairs were laid and microphones installed, said Basu.A case was registered against Basu and Sarkar when they blocked a road and held a meeting at another location close to the district administrations office. The restrictions were imposed because we were anticipating law and order problems, said Dhiman Mitra, deputy superintendent of police.The TMC hit back at the BJP saying the saffron party should first control its belligerent state unit chief who recently made inflammatory statements.Maintaining law and order is the responsibility of the administration and it has to do its job. Before accusing the state of using Section 144 against it, the BJP should first control its own state president who talks of shooting protesters. BJP has never been stopped from holding meetings and processions, said minister of state for parliamentary affairs and senior TMC leader Tapas Roy.On Sunday, BJPs Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh had said that those damaging government properties were killed like dogs in states ruled by his party. That comment drew wide condemnation. The BJP is not the only party to be shackled by prohibitory orders. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has run into the same obstacle. The TMC government has not spared the Marxists either. They enforced Section 144 in quite a few districts to stop our programmes. We, however, did not violate most of those orders, said CPI (M) legislator Sujan Chakraborty.',\n",

Australia won the toss and opted to bat first in the series opener and their bowlers got them off to a perfect start as Indian opener Rohit Sharma was dismissed cheaply before Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul steadied the ship for India.While Dhawan slammed a brilliant half-century and looked in good touch, Rahul also played a crucial knock of 47 runs. After the duo's departure, the onus was on Indian skipper Virat Kohli to help India reach a big total but he failed to get going and was dismissed cheaply by Adam Zampa, who showed great reflexes and took a brilliant catch to dismiss the right-hander.Kohli, who changed his batting position to number four to accommodate both Dhawan and Rahul in the playing XI, came out to bat in the middle in the 28th over with India on 134/2. He started off well but was once again sent packing by Zampa, who has dismissed him four times in ODIs already.In the 32nd over of the Indian innings, Kohli dispatched Zampa for a six on the first ball before smashing another drive. Kohli played it straight towards the spinner, who showed great reflexes and pounced on to the catch to ensure the Indian skipper's departure.

If anyone can chip in, thats great because its nice to show solidarity and help in a situation, which has become quite incredible in this country, the 38-year-old said, joining other tennis players in pledging funds.The 20-time Grand Slam winner and current world number three said he would pledge the funds at a charity match he will take part in later this week to raise funds for the appeal ahead of the Australian Open starting on January 20. Tennis players have been quick to respond to the bushfire crisis, which has left at least 27 people dead and burned an area the size of South Korea.Players on the mens tour have donated US$500,000, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) said on Sunday, while Serena Williams handed over her $43,000 winners cheque from the Auckland Classic on Sunday. Climate activists meanwhile on Monday stepped up a campaign urging Federer to either persuade Credit Suisse to stop investing in fossil fuels or cut ties with them.The Swiss champion responded over the weekend after Swedish campaigner Thunberg retweeted a message criticising Credit Suisse with the hashtag #RogerWakeUpNow. Federer said in a statement widely quoted by media that he took climate change very seriously and promised to dialogue on important issues with my sponsors.But campaigners pressed Federer to go further, urging him to become a climate champion in an online petition that had garnered more than 8,000 signatures on Monday. When you speak, people usually listen, read the petition posted on the website Campax, accusing Credit Suisse of funding climate chaos around the world.The campaign is supported by Lausanne Climate Action, a Swiss organisation that is also defending a group of activists who played tennis inside a Credit Suisse branch in 2018 in protest against Federers sponsorship deal.The activists, who were initially fined 21,000 Swiss francs (19,400 euros, $21,600), were acquitted on appeal in the Swiss town of Renens on Monday.Credit Suisse last month said it would stop financing new coal-fired power plants and has said it will seek to align its portfolios with the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit global warming.',\n",

       " 'Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Udayanraje Bhosale, who is a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, on Tuesday slammed the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for misusing the Maratha warrior kings name.Udayanraje Bhosale, who represented Satara in the Lok Sabha, was speaking to reporters after a controversy over a book comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the 17-century Maratha king erupted over the weekend.The Congress had said it would stage protests across Maharashtra on Tuesday and the NCP demanded the immediate withdrawal of the book while the Sena had said the BJP should ban the books distribution and officially announce that it has no links to the books publication.The BJP on Monday announced the withdrawal of Aaj Ke Shivaji - Narendra Modi  written by one of its functionaries Jai Bhagwan Goyal, a former Sena activist in Delhi, after the uproar by Maharashtras ruling parties, the Sena, Congress and NCP.Bhosale accused those opposed to the book, including the Sena and NCP, of double-speak and said they dont raise any objection when NCP president Sharad Pawar is called the Janata Raja, a title exclusively used for Shivaji in Maharashtra. Calling someone Janata Raja is belittling Shivaji Maharaj. Nobody in the world can be compared to Shivaji Maharaj, Bhosale said, without taking Pawars name. Pawar is known as the Janata Raja in political circles.Did the Shiv Sena ask the descendants when it used Shivajis name in the partys title? Sena has named vada pav scheme after Shivaji, which is an insult to the warrior kings name. Various parties have not only misused Shivajis name, but insulted the king in various ways, said Bhosale. The former MP then went on to ask Sena if it has the guts to rename their party. Remove the word Shiv from Shiv Sena and rename it as Thackeray Sena. I would like to see when you change the name, how many people stand behind you, said Bhosale. Senior Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut had also asked Udayanraje Bhosale and Shivendraraje Bhosale, another descendant of Shivaji, to resign over the issue. The descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who are occupying the seat of Satara and Kolhapur, are in the BJP. Some are MPs, some are MLAs and some are former MLAs. We asked them to take a stand on the comparison of Maharaj with political leaders. Whats wrong in that? Raut asked.We, the common people, are fighting for the respect of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and we will do so. But you are descendants of Shivaji Maharaj and the biggest responsibility falls on your shoulders. You should have immediately resigned, he said.Irked over Rauts remarks, Bhosale hit out at the Sena asking why Uddhav Thackeray led the party, which is leading the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance government in the state, drop the word shiv from Maha Shiv Aghadi?. Maha Shiv Aghadi was the word coined by the media and promoted by the Sena, Congress, NCP leaders before the three-party alliance was formalised last year. Udayanraje Bhosale was defeated during the recently-held Lok Sabha by-polls, which were necessitated after he resigned as the MP and joined the BJP. ',\n",
       " 'MANILA (Reuters) - Nearly 40,000 people have been evacuated from near a Philippine volcano that could erupt violently at any moment, authorities said on Tuesday, but thousands more are refusing to leave or have already drifted back. A cloud of ash and fountains of lava gushed for a third day from the crater of Taal, which lies in the middle of a lake about 70 km (45 miles) south of the center of the Philippines capital Manila. Everyone living within 14 km (9 miles) of the volcano has been ordered to leave: potentially as many as 300,000 people, though disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said he believed the actual number who had been there was much lower. Officially, 38,200 have now been evacuated, the agency said. Local officials complained that many others were complicating the evacuation effort by staying put. I had to put Talisay under lockdown to prevent residents, who were already in the evacuation centers from returning, said Gerry Natanauan, mayor of one town that is well within the danger zone of the 311 meter (1,020-foot) volcano.  They wanted to check their homes, possessions and animals, but theyre not supposed to do that because it is very dangerous.  Although Taal is one of the worlds smallest active volcanoes, it has a deadly history: an eruption in 1911 killed more than 1,300 people. Several new fissures have opened, emitting plumes of steam, while dozens of tremors were felt as far as in Tagaytay city, a popular tourist destination 32 km (20 miles) away.  If an eruption happened, nobody would be able to return to their homes because they would be devastated, said Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Philvocs). The threat is really real, he told a media briefing. However, many refused to heed the warnings. In part of Balete town, which sits on the edge of the danger zone, Red Cross trucks were sent to bring out 1,000 residents, but they left with only 130 because people thought they were far enough from the volcano, local authorities said.  No casualties have been reported so far, and seismologists said there was a chance this eruption could subside, but the signs still point to an imminent explosion. Visiting the area on Tuesday, President Rodrigo Duterte joked that the government could try a traditional way to calm the volcano down. You should go there and, you know, say a little prayer and offer something. Lets go by the primitive way of doing it just like what our forefathers would do, he was quoted as saying by the Inquirer.Net website. Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, most recently in 1977. A 1754 eruption lasted for months. The Philippines lies on the Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes. In Manila, government offices reopened on Tuesday after being closed on Monday because of a fine layer of ash that drifted from the volcano, but schools remained shut and many people still wore face masks.

       " 'Helicopter-borne marksmen killed more than 5,000 camels in a five-day cull of feral herds that were threatening indigenous communities in drought-stricken areas of southern Australia, officials said Tuesday.Aboriginal leaders in South Australia state said extremely large herds of the non-native camels had been driven towards rural communities by drought and extreme heat, threatening scarce food and drinking water, damaging infrastructure, and creating a dangerous hazard for drivers.The cull in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands -- home to about 2,300 indigenous people in the arid northwest of South Australia -- ended on Sunday, said APY general manager Richard King.We appreciate the concerns of animal rights activists, but there is significant misinformation about the realities of life for non-native feral animals, in what is among the most arid and remote places on Earth, King said in a statement on Tuesday.As custodians of the land, we need to deal with an introduced pest in a way that protects valuable water supplies for communities and puts the lives of everyone, including our young children, the elderly, and native flora and fauna first.King said weakened camels frequently became stuck and died in water holes, contaminating water sources needed by locals and native animals and birds.The prolonged dry period, while not difficult for native wildlife, leads to extreme distress for feral camels, he said.APY officials said the operation had removed more than 5,000 camels. The cull came as Australia experienced its hottest and driest year on record in 2019, with the severe drought causing some towns to run out of water and fuelling deadly bushfires that have devastated the countrys southeast.Camels were first introduced to Australia in the 1840s to aid in the exploration of the continents vast interior, with up to 20,000 imported from India in the six decades that followed.Australia is now thought to have the largest wild camel population in the world, with official estimates suggesting more than one million are roaming the countrys inland deserts.The animals are considered a pest, as they foul water sources and trample native flora while foraging for food over vast distances each day.Traditional owners in the APY Lands have for years mustered and sold off feral camels.But more recently they have been unable to manage the scale and number of camels that congregate in dry conditions, according to the environment department.',\n",

Pyaar Hai (KNPH; 2000), says the actor, before narrating how on seeing her at a wedding, the filmmaker decided to launch her alongside his son, Hrithik Roshan, in the successful romantic thriller that clocks 20 years today.I wasnt supposed to go for this party. My mother was unwell so I accompanied my father. We were leaving when Rakesh uncle was entering. He did not recognise me and asked my father, Amit who is this pretty young girl with you?. The funniest thing is that after watching me dance at a common friends sangeet when I was 14/15, he expressed his desire to launch me alongside Hrithik. But my father declined, Ameesha says, adding that her father and Roshan senior went to the same school. This time, she and her family were invited by the Roshans for lunch. After we got done, Rakesh uncle offered me the film. I was on the set on the fourth day. We started with the cruise scene, thatll always stay with me as a beautiful memory, she says, adding, I got lucky I dont think I wouldve asked for any other film to begin my journey. Calling her two-decade-long journey as beautiful and KNPH a benchmark of her career, Ameesha says, Right from Gadar (2001), Humraaz (2002), Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Honeymoon Travels Pvt.

In order to accommodate the in-form trio of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul, Kohli changed his favourite batting position from No. 3 to No.4.

       " 'Irans judiciary has described the UKs ambassador to Tehran as persona non grata and called for his expulsion, while crowds of regime supporters burned his effigy alongside the British flag.The actions came after the envoy, Rob Macaire, was briefly arrested at the weekend and accused of coordinating anti-government protests.Placards of Macaire were set alight in Tehran on Tuesday as a judiciary spokesman accused the diplomat of interfering in [Irans] internal affairs in breach of diplomatic conventions.Under international law, such a person is a persona non grata. The people expect the person to be expelled and that is also what international law calls for, Gholamhossein Esmaili said, according to state media.Diplomatic spat between Iran & UK continues after British ambassador was briefly detained at a protest. Judiciary spox says he didnt respect intl. law & should be expelled, as he is persona non grata in #Iran. Hardliners burn effigy of ambassador along with US & UK flags. pic.twitter.com/WwFdLZBogiThe labelling of Macaire, 53, as persona non grata  an official term that prohibits a diplomat from staying in a country  was not thought to be a formal declaration with legal consequences.But it threatens to further sour a diplomatic relationship that is already strained by disputes over British citizens in Iranian jails, alleged outstanding debts for decades-old arms deals and the seizure of oil tankers.Macaire was arrested on Saturday night about 30 minutes after he says he left a vigil for those killed onboard a Ukraine International Airlines flight mistakenly shot down by Iranian missiles. He is immune to prosecution in Iran under international law and was released a short time later.He has denied playing any role in the protests that have erupted in parts of Tehran and the rest of the country in recent days.Small demonstrations continued to be held at several universities on Tuesday and there were reports of a temporary nationwide internet outage in the early evening, raising fears authorities could cut off Iranian networks from the world as they did during a massive outbreak of protests in November.The arrest appears to have been a mistake on the part of Tehran police, but Irans embattled government has taken the opportunity to deflect away some of the public anger it has faced over the revelation it shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, then denied having done so for three days.The judiciary on Tuesday announced the first arrests had been made over the accidental shooting down of the airliner last Wednesday, which killed all 176 passengers.Esmaili was quoted saying extensive investigations have taken place and some individuals are arrested. He did not name anyone or say how many had been held.The countrys president, Hassan Rouhani, in separate remarks called for a special court to be established to investigate the downing of the aircraft, which has triggered protests, rare apologies from the government and a wave of resignations from state-run media outlets.Officials in the country had initially insisted the aircraft had suffered a technical fault and crashed, but admitted on Saturday morning it had been shot down after foreign investigators had arrived in the country and images had emerged on social media showing missile debris near the crash site. The judiciary should form a special court with a ranking judge and dozens of experts, Rouhani said in a televised speech in Iran on Tuesday. This is not an ordinary case. The entire world will be watching this court.Rouhani called the incident a painful and unforgivable mistake and promised that his administration would pursue the case by all means.The responsibility falls on more than just one person, he said, adding that those found culpable should be punished.Irans Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the hardline military organisation set up to defend the regime, has taken responsibility for the incident, which occurred about five hours after Iranian missiles were fired at US forces stationed in Iraq and while its forces were on high alert for reprisals.The Guards aerospace chief, Ali Hajizadeh, said last weekend that a missile operator had been told that the US had fired back at Iranian territory and mistook the plane for a cruise missile. He was unable to contact his superiors to ask if he should fire at the target and made the bad choice, Hajizadeh said.On Tuesday, footage emerged that appeared to show the plane was hit by two missiles fired from a Iranian military facility. The footage, which was posted on YouTube, showed that the airliner was not downed immediately, but caught fire and circled back towards Tehran airport before crashing.The overt and at times emotional claim of responsibility from what is usually a secretive organisation is unusual but they had no choice, said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow at Londons Royal United Services Institute.The evidence was clear and others had the evidence, she said. They have tried to play the card of being seen as transparent and cooperative.Hajizadeh had said his organisation asked for the airspace over Tehran to be closed before the accident but that our dear brothers [in the government] didnt follow up the issue for certain considerations.But Bassiri said there had nonetheless been unusually little public sniping between competing factions and institutions inside the Iranian government over the incident. There has been a focus on unity, she said.The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians  including many Iranians with dual citizenship  and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials. There were 15 children among the passengers, including an infant.Iran shot down the plane when it was braced for possible US retaliation over a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing US troops in Iraq. No one was hurt in that attack, which was carried out to avenge the killing of the Revolutionary Guards leader, Qassem Suleimani, in an American airstrike in Baghdad.The downing and the lack of transparency around it has reignited anger in Iran at the countrys leadership, with protesters taking to the streets. Videos and witness accounts appeared to show security forces firing live ammunition and teargas to disperse protests.Associated Press contributed to this report',\n",

       " 'Spanish champions Barcelona have sacked their coach Ernesto Valverde and appointed Quique Setien as his replacement, the club announced on Monday.  The decision to remove Valverde was confirmed following a board meeting that lasted more than four hours at Camp Nou on Monday afternoon.Barca are top of La Liga but have won only one of their last five matches. Valverde is the first coach the club has sacked mid-season since Louis van Gaal in 2003.FC Barcelona and Ernesto Valverde have reached an agreement to terminate the contract that united both parties, read a club statement released on Monday night.Setien will be presented in a press conference at Camp Nou at 2.30pm local time (1330 GMT) on Tuesday.Barcelona and Quique Setien have reached an agreement for the latter to become first team coach until 30 June 2022, the club said. Setien is one of the most experienced coaches in Spanish football, it added. Throughout his career he has been a proponent of possession based, attacking football that has been attractive to the fans.His first game in charge will be at home to Granada on Sunday. Barcelona play Napoli in the last 16 of the Champions League next month and Real Madrid in the league at the start of March. Setien has made no secret of his admiration for the stylistic traditions of Barcelona, with the 61-year-old also renowned for favouring an exciting, offensive mode of football. A former player of Atletico Madrid and Racing Santander, he was circled as a potential Barca coach during a particularly successful period in charge of Real Betis. Setien led Betis to a sixth-place finish in 2018 and qualification for the Europa League but, despite overseeing a thrilling 4-3 victory at Camp Nou early the following season, results tailed off. Betis finished 10th and the club and coach parted ways in the summer. Previously, he also helped Las Palmas avoid relegation from La Liga in 2016. A footballing purist, Setien and Barcelona would seem a good fit, particularly if the players feel released from some of Valverdes more pragmatic tendencies. But critics of Setien would argue style often takes precedence over substance and it remains to be seen how he handles the pressure of matching aesthetics with results at one of the worlds most demanding clubs. He will also have to do without Luis Suarez, who will be missing for the next four months after having surgery on his right knee. - European failures haunt Valverde -Doubts had surrounded Valverde for several months and were underpinned by two disastrous exits from the Champions League. Barcelonas shocking collapse against Roma in 2018 was followed by a similar capitulation against Liverpool last year. Familiar fragility had been evident this season and a 3-2 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup on Thursday, in which Barcelona conceded two late goals, prompted the board to act. Valverde arrived two hours early for his last training session with the squad at Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper on Monday morning before meeting with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Bartomeu then drove to Camp Nou, where he held a board meeting with several club officials including chief executive Oscar Grau, technical secretary Javier Bordas, vice president Jordi Cardoner and sporting director Eric Abidal. Grau and Abidal had returned to Barcelona on Sunday after spending the weekend in Qatar, where they had offered the job to Xavi, only for the clubs iconic former midfielder to indicate he was not ready to come immediately. In Valverdes two seasons, his team won two La Liga titles, as well as the Copa del Rey in 2018, and another league success remained very much in sight this term, despite Madrids impressive form in recent weeks. But Barcas performances have been unconvincing and there were lingering concerns about Valverdes more functional tactics, which appear to have informed the switch to Setien. When Valverde arrived in 2017, Barcelona were wounded, hurting after the shock departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain and humiliated, as consecutive defeats by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup hinted at trouble for the season ahead. Instead, he steadied the ship and galvanised the team. They lost one league game en route to winning the title and the year after, they were champions again, finishing 11 points ahead of Atletico and 19 clear of Real. Increasingly, though, Valverdes achievements faded from view and his failures began to overshadow them. On Monday, Barcelona decided his time was up.',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A meteorite that crashed into rural southeastern Australia in a fireball in 1969 contained the oldest material ever found on Earth, stardust that predated the formation of our solar system by billions of years, scientists said on Monday. The oldest of 40 tiny dust grains trapped inside the meteorite fragments retrieved around the town of Murchison in Victoria state dated from about 7 billion years ago, about 2.5 billion years before the sun, Earth and rest of our solar system formed, the researchers said. In fact, all of the dust specks analyzed in the research came from before the solar systems formation - thus known as presolar grains - with 60% of them between 4.6 and 4.9 billion years old and the oldest 10% dating to more than 5.6 billion years ago. The stardust represented time capsules dating to before the solar system. The age distribution of the dust - many of the grains were concentrated at particular time intervals - provided clues about the rate of star formation in the Milky Way galaxy, the researchers said, hinting at bursts of stellar births rather than a constant rate. I find this extremely exciting, said Philipp Heck, an associate curator at the Field Museum in Chicago who led the research published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Despite having worked on the Murchison meteorite and presolar grains for almost 20 years, I still am fascinated that we can study the history of our galaxy with a rock, Heck added. The grains are small, measuring from 2 to 30 micrometers   in size. A micrometer is a one-thousandth of a millimeter or about 0.000039 of an inch. Stardust forms in the material ejected from stars and carried by stellar winds, getting blown into interstellar space. During the solar systems birth, this dust was incorporated into everything that formed including the planets and the sun but survived intact until now only in asteroids and comets. The researchers detected the tiny grains inside the meteorite by crushing fragments of the rock and then segregating the component parts in a paste they described as smelling like rotten peanut butter. Scientists have developed a method to determine stardusts age. Dust grains floating through space get bombarded by high-energy particles called cosmic rays. These rays break down atoms in the grain into fragments, such as carbon into helium. These fragments accumulate over time and their production rate is rather constant. The longer the exposure time to cosmic rays, the more fragments accumulate. The researchers counted these fragments in the laboratory, enabling them to calculate the stardusts age. Scientists previously had found a presolar grain in the Murchison meteorite that was about 5.5 billion years old, until now the oldest-known solid material on Earth. The oldest-known minerals that formed on Earth are found in rock from Australias Jack Hills that formed 4.4 billion years ago, 100 million years after the planet formed.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called on U.S. President Donald Trump to replace the Iranian nuclear deal with his own new agreement to ensure that the Islamic Republic did not get an atomic weapon. If were going to get rid of it, lets replace it and lets replace it with the Trump deal, Johnson said of the 2015 nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. That would be a great way forward. President Trump is a great deal maker, by his own account. Lets work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead, Johnson told the BBC. Under the deal brokered in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to restrict its nuclear program. But in 2018, Trump pulled out of the deal. European powers have repeatedly said they still support the deal though Tehran announced earlier this month it would abandon limitations on enriching uranium, a further blow to the deal. If you get rid of this nuclear deal, the JCPOA, its what Trump wants. My point to our American friends is, look, somehow or other youve got to stop the Iranians acquiring a nuclear weapon, Johnson said. From the American perspective, its a flawed agreement, it expires, plus it was negotiated by President (Barack) Obama. From their point of view it has many, many faults. Trump is confident he could still renegotiate a new nuclear deal with Tehran, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said earlier this month after Iran announced it would retreat further from the 2015 nuclear pact.  I dont want a military conflict between us, the United States and Iran, lets dial this thing down, Johnson said. Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Kate Holton; editing by Michael Holden',\n",

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - The British government secretly funded Reuters in the 1960s and 1970s at the behest of an anti-Soviet propaganda unit linked to British intelligence and concealed the funding by using the BBC to make the payments, declassified government documents show. The money was used to expand Reuters coverage of the Middle East and Latin America and hidden by increased news subscription payments to Reuters from the BBC.  We are now in a position to conclude an agreement providing discreet Government support for Reuter services in the Middle East and Latin America, according to a redacted 1969 British government document marked Secret and entitled Funding of Reuters by HMG. HMGs interests should be well served by the new arrangement, said the document, which was declassified last year. HMG stands for Her Majestys Government. The extent of influence - if any - that the government was able to exert over Reuters news in return for the money is unclear from the documents, which detail a 1969 secret British government financing deal for Reuters.  However, the documents illustrate the level of involvement the government once had in Reuters affairs and the explicit agreement to conceal the financing. Earlier on Monday, the BBC published a story about the government funding. here Many news organizations received some form of state subsidy after World War Two, David Crundwell, a spokesman for Reuters said.  But the arrangement in 1969 was not in keeping with our Trust Principles and we would not do this today, said Crundwell, referring to the Reuters Trust Principles, designed to preserve the news agencys integrity, independence and freedom from bias. The news gathering activities of Reuters are overseen by the Founders Share Company, which was created in 1984 to uphold the Trust Principles. The principles stipulate that no single interest, group or faction should come to dominate Reuters. here While Reuters sells news to a broad array of customers including governments, no government exercises control over how or what Reuters produces, Crundwell said. A BBC spokeswoman said: The BBC charter guarantees editorial independence irrespective of whether funding comes from the UK government, the license fee or commercial sources. A British government spokeswoman declined to comment. The documents show the Information Research Department (IRD), a British anti-Soviet propaganda unit with close ties to British intelligence, led negotiations with Reuters. The British governments funding of Reuters in the 1960s and 1970s was disclosed in a 1992 authorized history of the news agency The Power of News: The History of Reuters. In 1969, Reuters needed money to further expand in the Middle East and Western powers such as Britain wanted to bolster their influence against the Soviet Union by expanding news services across the world, the documents showed. The secret government financing of Reuters  - as set out in the documents - amounted to 245,000 pounds ($317,838 at current exchange rates) per year before 1969 but then reduced to 100,000 pounds per year in 1969-1970 and nothing in 1972-1973. The new relationship established with Reuters in the Middle East and Latin America can lead to valuable goodwill and cooperation with the Agency on a global scale, John Peck, former head of the IRD, said in the documents.  The documents said that Reuters could and would provide what the government needed, though the government officials conceded that Reuters did not want to appear to be taking decisions at the behest of the British government.

       " 'Be warned. If the rise of the robots comes to pass, the apocalypse may be a more squelchy affair than science fiction writers have prepared us for.Researchers in the US have created the first living machines by assembling cells from African clawed frogs into tiny robots that move around under their own steam.One of the most successful creations has two stumpy legs that propel it along on its chest. Another has a hole in the middle that researchers turned into a pouch so it could shimmy around with miniature payloads.These are entirely new lifeforms. They have never before existed on Earth, said Michael Levin, the director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. They are living, programmable organisms.Roboticists tend to favour metal and plastic for their strength and durability, but Levin and his colleagues see benefits in making robots from biological tissues. When damaged, living robots can heal their wounds, and once their task is done they fall apart, just as natural organisms decay when they die.Their unique features mean that future versions of the robots might be deployed to clean up microplastic pollution in the oceans, locate and digest toxic materials, deliver drugs in the body or remove plaque from artery walls, the scientists say.Its impossible to know what the applications will be for any new technology, so we can really only guess, said Joshua Bongard, a senior researcher on the team at the University of Vermont.The robots, which are less than 1mm long, are designed by an evolutionary algorithm that runs on a supercomputer. The program starts by generating random 3D configurations of 500 to 1,000 skin and heart cells. Each design is then tested in a virtual environment, to see, for example, how far it moves when the heart cells are set beating. The best performers are used to spawn more designs, which themselves are then put through their paces.Because heart cells spontaneously contract and relax, they behave like miniature engines that drive the robots along until their energy reserves run out. The cells have enough fuel inside them for the robots to survive for a week to 10 days before keeling over.The scientists waited for the computer to churn out 100 generations before picking a handful of designs to build in the lab. They used tweezers and cauterising tools to sculpt early-stage skin and heart cells scraped from the embryos of African clawed frogs, Xenopus laevis. The source of the cells led the scientists to call their creations xenobots.Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe how they set the robots loose in dishes of water to keep the frog cells alive. Some crept along in straight lines, while others looped around in circles or teamed up with others as they moved around.These are very small, but ultimately the plan is to make them to scale, said Levin. Xenobots might be built with blood vessels, nervous systems and sensory cells, to form rudimentary eyes. By building them out of mammalian cells, they could live on dry land.Sam Kriegman, a PhD student on the team at the University of Vermont, acknowledged that the work raised ethical issues, particularly given that future variants could have nervous systems and be selected for cognitive capability, making them more active participants in the world. Whats important to me is that this is public, so we can have a discussion as a society and policymakers can decide what is the best course of action.He was less concerned about xenobots posing any threat to humankind. If you watch the video, its hard to fear that these things are taking over any time soon, he said.But the work aims to achieve more than just the creation of squidgy robots. The aim is to understand the software of life, Levin said. If you think about birth defects, cancer, age-related diseases, all of these things could be solved if we knew how to make biological structures, to have ultimate control over growth and form.The research is funded by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencys lifelong learning machines programme, which aims to recreate biological learning processes in machines.Thomas Douglas, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, said: There are interesting ethical questions about the moral status of these xenobots. At what point would they become beings with interests that ought to be protected? I think theyd acquire moral significance only if they included neural tissue that enabled some kind of mental life, such as the ability to experience pain.But some are more liberal about moral status. They think that all living creatures have interests that should be given some moral consideration. For these people, difficult questions could arise about whether these xenobots should be classified as living creatures or machines.',\n",

       " \"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday that the victims of the Ukrainian airliner shot down in Iran would still be alive if the recent escalation of tensions in the region had not happened, according to a transcript of an interview with Global News TV. The U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in a Jan. 3 drone strike prompted Iran to launch a missile attack on Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops on Jan. 8, hours before the passenger jet was shot down. All 176 aboard were killed, including 57 Canadians. I think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families, Trudeau said in the interview. Trudeau said Canada did not receive a heads up before the United States killed Soleimani, and that he obviously would have preferred one.   The U.S. makes its determinations. We attempt to work as an international community on big issues. But sometimes countries take actions without informing their allies, he said.  Trudeau said that while the government was working as quickly as possible to bring the bodies home for burial, it was likely to take weeks or perhaps even months. Canada said on Monday that Iran had signaled that Canadian investigators would take an active role in the probe of the crash, which Iran said at the weekend had been caused by a missile it fired in a disastrous mistake.

The Kolkata-based designer, who started her career in 1998, is known for modernising Indian craft. Though her collections are graciously Indian, they also have strong shades of bohemian and goth. Khanna was among the 33 designers to be part of Indias first Lakme Fashion Week, which took place at Taj Palace, New Delhi in 1999. Talk show Czarina Oprah has worn her outfits at various occasions, and a 10 kg velvet lehenga, studded with pearls, gold and silver, designed by Khanna was gifted to Lady Gaga by Simi Garewal, during her talk show, Simi Selects Indias Most Desirable.Her twin sons, Vishesh and Viraj have also joined her firm, and were behind the AK-OK collection, launched in late-2018. In an open chat, the designer spoke to us about how Kolkata has influenced her, whether shes a scary boss, not taking holidays and much more.Has Kolkata had any part to play in honing your fashion sense?For a designer, it is very natural to be impacted and to be influenced by where you live and the people you meet. Living in Kolkata, I think number one, Ive been able to find my own space and find my own voice and not get crowded.Secondly, I also feel that in Kolkata, there is an inherent craft and culture. And you automatically imbibe that as you grow up there. So yes, Kolkata has been a very big influence.Kolkata has the most vibrant culture in all of India. Which is your favourite club there? (Starts laughing) Thats an interesting question. Living in Kolkata you cannot run away from the clubs since theyre an inherent part of your life. I would say RCGC is one of my favourites!And your favourite restaurant?Chinoiserie, at the Taj Bengal.You have the unique distinction of being one of the people whove actually met the Queen of England and the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace. What was that like?The whole feeling was ethereal, it was like we were in a movie.How easy or difficult has it been for you to maintain the position youve reached in the fashion industry? I dont think anything comes easy. Unless you give it all youve got with everything that youve got, youre not going to be able to achieve the enormous target you set for yourself. I have worked non-stop for the last 20 years. I dont think Ive had a day when Ive actually put my feet up and said, Okay, Im not working. Its not been easy, but its a journey that I chose and that I love.Are you trying to say that in the last 20 years you havent taken a day off? Yes, because your mind is always working. Even when youre on a holiday you are inspired by something and youre back at work. Its not like one doesnt take days off, but youre always at it. Its just something that you love so it just becomes a part of you.Would you prefer Netflix or a party out?Netflix.With regards to fashion, who is your favourite, Madonna or Michael Jackson?Madonna, because of the fact that over the years shes been able to be reinvent herself and yet be so powerful at her age and have that energy and the charisma.People say is that Anamika Khanna has a reputation of being elusive. Would you agree or disagree with that?(Laughs) Im just shy, not elusive. Secondly, I stay in Kolkata, so Im not available for everything. Generally, as a person, I just feel that I would like my work to talk rather than me speaking, so yes, people get the impression that I might be elusive.Is Anamika Khanna the kind of boss who people would be afraid of?(Laughs again) People are petrified!

The date of Patras appointment has not been specified yet.The Reserve Bank currently has three deputy governors--NS Vishwanathan, BP Kanungo and MK Jain. Patra will be the fourth among the deputy governors. Shaktikanta Das is the governor of RBI.Acharya had resigned in July 2019, six months before the end of his tenure. Though Acharya had citied unavoidable personal reasons for his resignation, it was widely speculated that he stepped down due to RBIs spat with the government over various issues such as transfer of surplus reserves to the Centre, norms for classification of non-performing assets and inflation-focused interest rates.After his speech Ongoing Challenges in Maintaining Independence of the Reserve Bank of India in October 2018, Acharyas exit was widely anticipated. In his speech, Acharya had strongly criticised the governments interference in the functioning of RBI that deprived the regulator of its independence.Acharya had emphasised the need for autonomy of central banks to supervise public-sector lenders.One important limitation the central bank faces is that it is statutorily limited in undertaking the full scope of actions against public-sector banks (PSBs)  such as asset divestiture, replacement of management and board, license revocation, and resolution actions such as mergers and sales. The apex bank exercises these powers effectively in the case of private banks,\" Acharya said.He had also said the governments that did not respect their central bank\\'s independence would, sooner or later, incur the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fire, and come to rue the day they undermined the regulatory institution.Soon after Acharyas speech, the then governor Urjit Patel had resigned in December 2018, amid conflicts with the Centre.

Devgn, who is basking in the success of his latest release Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, believes social media has washed away the mystery around stardom.The stardom era has been washed (away) by social media now and by actors themselves, who constantly keep sharing information about their lives. Earlier, we would imagine how they lived, what they did but now people think they (stars) are just like them.I am not too much (active) on social media. I believe an actor should be known for their work and not for social media activity. Wherever I go, I get respect and that makes you feel good. I have always done my own thing, the actor told PTI in an interview here.Tanhaji is Devgns 100th film and the actor, who began his career in 1991 with Phool Aur Kante, considers himself lucky to have stayed relevant for audiences thanks to his varied film choices. I have been lucky to be doing different kind of roles and they have worked too because so many actors struggle to do different things.   At that time nobody was doing a film like Raincoat. I just wanted to try out different things, hence I did it. There was no fear whether it will work or not. I am glad my risk paid off. A lot of people advised me against such films but today almost everyone is doing such films and they are working.  Of all the 100 films that he has acted in his 29 year-long career, historical films like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior have touched him the most.   Something like Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior or Legend of Bhagat Singh makes you think that how is it possible that such sacrifices are made by people? We cant even think of (it). They must be different people, what they think and how they function. Country came first for them.   Tanhaji, also featuring Saif Ali Khan, Kajol and Sharad Kelkar, has earned Rs 61.93 crore in its first weekend.

They are the ones who are the most honest and unforgiving judge of films. I also took along members of my staff to see their reaction.Chhapaak is based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal, and stars Deepika Padukone and Vikrant Massey in lead roles. Praising Meghnas direction, Rakhee continued, There were so many youngsters in the theatre, all watching in rapt attention.

I am very proud of my daughter.Chhapaak has opened to positive reviews, with particular praise going to Deepikas performance and Meghnas restrained treatment of the intense subject. The film was pitted against Ajay Devgns considerably larger period epic, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, and has made approximately Rs 21 in four days of release.

Ramakrishna, here on Monday, said 62 loans had locked up  300 crore of deposit.\"Your money is 100 per cent safe with Sri Guru Raghavendra Sahakara Bank. It\\'s my responsibility,\" Ramakrishna said at Sri Guru Narasimha Kalyanamandira auditorium, to assure depositors.Because of these 62 dud loans, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had restricted the lender from executing business, he said amid shouting by depositors.To assuage customers, the call to an assistant commissioner of police by Bengaluru South MP Tejaswi Surya -- not present -- was relayed on loudspeaker live and the MP claimed that he had spoken to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to help the customers.Ramakrishna said he would meet customers again on January 19 with all the details and numbers.Dramatic scenes and pandemonium ruled the auditorium before his arrival. Thousands of bank customers threatened to go en masse to the police station and file a case against Ramakrishna.As he addressed the gathering in Kannada, hundreds of depositors shouted back at him seeking clarifications.\"The bank is saying I can\\'t withdraw more than  35,000. In case of our fixed deposit maturing, we will have to renew it as we can\\'t encash it, \" said Nagaraj M, 49, who has been dealing with the bank for the past six years.At the auditorium, thousands of depositors earlier demanded the bank chairman\\'s presence to clarify the matter.The lender had invited depositors to the auditorium at 6 p.m. to update them on the bank\\'s status, following a RBI directive restricting the bank from doing business with immediate effect.\"We want the bank\\'s directors here,\" shouted a depositor from the stage. A handful of policemen were trying to control the crowd and bring order to the assembly.Many elderly and retired persons had arrived to know the fate of their savings. Several women were also present at the meeting.\"It was a good bank with only 0.5 per cent NPAs. Now we can\\'t trust any bank.

       " 'NEW DELHI :Microsoft is finally pulling the plug on Windows 7. Post 14 January, the nine-year-old operating system for laptop and desktop PCs will not receive any support, including security updates, leaving users exposed to cybersecurity risks. Microsoft has urged Windows 7 users to upgrade to Windows 10.This will give a huge boost to PC business in Asia as 35% of the enterprise PCs in Asia are still running on Windows 7, as per GlobalData, a UK-based data and analytics firm.Businesses which are still holding on to Windows 7 will have to either upgrade their licenses to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise via Volume Licensing for existing PCs, or to buy new PCs altogether.We expect businesses in Asia to offset some of their needs by purchasing new PCs. This should reflect in a slight bump in PC sales in 2020. However, most enterprises in the cost-conscious markets of Asia will choose the more cost effective option of upgrading their existing compatible PCs to Windows 10,\" Nishant Singh, head of technology and telecoms data at GlobalData, said in a press statement.The reports further points out that market for new PCs in Asia was worth $39.4 billion in 2019 and India accounted for around 20% for it.\"This will not lead to any business disruption as most big companies which are more pro-active about security have already upgraded to Windows 10. Many of the SMBs in sectors that are less susceptible to attacks are yet to upgrade, but we expect that to happen over the course of the next few quarters. We have seen Microsoft work pro-actively with partners, running campaigns and educating them on the benefits of the upgrade,\" said Jaipal Singh, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices at IDC India.Global Data pegs Windows 10 current market share in Asia at around 60%. Globally, market share of Windows 10 was 47.65%, while Windows 7 was 32.74%, as on December 2019, as per Netmarketshare.Windows 7 was followed by Windows 8 and 8.1, but they never got the same response due to the drastic changes in the UI to make the new OS user friendly for touchscreen based 2-in-1 laptops. The initial absence of Start Menu also drew lot of flak.According to Netmarketshare, Windows 8.1s global market share in 2019 was 4.09%.Singh rues, unfortunately for Microsoft, Windows 7 was followed by Windows 8, which like Windows Vista, was again mired in controversy. Sandwiched between two unpopular Windows releases, it is no surprise that enterprises held on to Windows 7 as long as they did. Some initial confusion around Windows 10s licensing and the Windows-as-a-service model also discouraged enterprises to move on from an established Windows 7 environment.In addition to older operating systems, SMBs in India are also known to be using older PCs to save cost. A December study, commissioned by Microsoft and carried out by market research firm TechAisle, found that 43% SMBs in India still own PCs that are more than four years old and are running older operating systems. According to the report, old PCs are 3.8 times more likely to need repairs, resulting in 132 hours of productive time lost.Mahesh Makhija, partner and leader, digital and emerging technology, EY India warned, Any amount that a company can save by compromising on employee laptops is not money worth saving. Employees waste weeks of productive time every year due to old, under-powered PCs, which not only slow down the overall pace of work in a business but cause significant employee frustration as well.\"',\n",

       " 'New Delhi: While taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi in connection with the current situation in the country, Congress leader Salman Khurshid said that the prime minister himself doesnt talk of ache din anymore. He, while speaking to ANI about the same, said, \"How long we will be told that inflation is under control? When will we get to know about \\'achhe din\\'? Nowadays, even the prime minister doesn\\'t mention why \\'achhe din\\' have not come and even if it has come, why it is not visible.Khurshids jibe at the prime minister was based on the ache din campaign that was run by the Bhartiya Janata Party ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The campaign included a slogan that said ache din aane vaale hain (good days are coming). The party made efficient use of the slogan and the larger campaign that went on to become one of the most loved and talked-about PR activities of the year. It was also credited for the massive win that BJP had during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.Khurshid also reacted to the rise in retail inflation rate under the present regime and went on to express his displeasure about the fact that the rise in retail inflation is going to hit the poor of the country the most. He added, \"It is very sad because inflation impacts the poor the most. Many of the social welfare schemes have been impacted by it and the budget has been reduced.According to government data, retail inflation rose to 7.35 per cent in December 2019 as compared to 5.54 per cent in the previous month.

       " 'The former pope Benedict XVI has spoken out against allowing married men to become priests, in a move that could jeopardise a potential plan by Pope Francis to change the centuries-old requirement in areas of the Amazon.Benedict, who implied upon his resignation in 2013 that he would not interfere with the work of his successor, has defended clerical celibacy in an explosive book written with the outspoken conservative cardinal Robert Sarah.In extracts of the book published by Frances Le Figaro newspaper on Sunday, the authors urged the Catholic church not to be swayed by bad pleas, theatrics, diabolical lies and fashionable errors that want to devalue priestly celibacy.Pope Francis agreed in October to consider a request from bishops in the Amazon to allow married men to become ordained in order to overcome a shortage of clerics in remote areas of the region.I cannot keep silent, Benedict, 92, wrote in the book, From the Depths of our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church.The authors said it was urgent that bishops, priests and laity let themselves be guided once more by faith as they look upon the church and on priestly celibacy that protects her mystery. Benedict, who promised to remain hidden after his resignation, has come forward on various issues over the past seven years, but this is the first time he has intervened on a matter that the more liberal Pope Francis is actively considering.Its a first for Benedict but also for the church, said Joshua McElwee, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. Theres a real worry that the figure of the former pope, who has a big following among those from more conservative circles, could prevent Francis from making a decision that he felt was right for the church.At the end of the Vatican synod on the Amazon, Francis said he would publish his decision on the ordination of married men later this year. If he supports the move, it would be limited to the Amazon region and would only apply to men already serving as deacons.A document approved by bishops in the Amazon noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have enormous difficulties in receiving communion and seeing a priest. It proposed to ordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community, who had already had fruitful experiences as deacons.The proposal is seen by many as setting a precedent that could bring an end to the restriction on married Catholic priests worldwide.The implications of Benedicts intervention are serious, given that conservative and traditionalist Catholics nostalgic for Benedicts orthodoxy are already deeply opposed to Francis. Some even consider Benedicts resignation illegitimate.Francis has been very clear on several occasions that he considers celibacy very important, he doesnt want to get rid of it completely and hes only considering this request because its coming from bishops on the ground citing the needs of Catholics, said McElwee.McElwee also pointed to a move Benedict made during his papacy to create norms that allowed Anglican priests who switched to Catholicism to join the church while remaining married.Massimo Faggioli, a historian and theologian who writes for the Catholic newspaper La Croix, criticised Benedicts move on Twitter: This is not about clerical celibacy, he wrote. Its about the freedom of one pope Francis AND of the synodal process.The intervention comes as Netflix airs the Two Popes, a drama about the relationship between Benedict and Francis. Benedict was the first pontiff to resign in 600 years and still lives within the walls of the Vatican. The pair are said to have a cordial relationship, but Franciss efforts at reform have made him unpopular among conservative Catholics.In a controversial essay published last year, Benedict blamed the Catholic churchs paedophile priest scandals on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and homosexual cliques among priests. His comments were in sharp conflict with Franciss efforts to steer the church out of a crisis that has blighted it for decades.',\n",

Russias defence ministry denounced what it said was Israels common practice of using civilian aircraft as a shield, Russia Today reported.Syria has to date struggled to repel Israeli airstrikes. In 2018, Bashar al-Assads forces accidentally shot down a reconnaissance plane belonging to its Russian allies while responding to an Israeli attack with anti-aircraft missiles, killing 15 crew members. Moscow held the Israeli air force accountable for the incident for allegedly using the Russian plane as cover.Spokespeople for the Israeli military and foreign ministry declined to comment.Israel does not normally comment on its military activity in Syria. Since the civil war broke out in 2011 it has carried out hundreds of airstrikes targeting Assads Iranian and Hezbollah allies, whose presence in Syria is regarded as an existential threat by Israel. Strikes normally target supply routes and infrastructure such as weapons depots.The Israel Defence Forces recently confirmed it has also begun operations in Iraq to stop Iran and its proxies from entrenching inside the country.Thursdays pre-dawn strikes in Syria were the most intense in months, targeting al-Kiswah, Marj al-Sultan and the Baghdad Bridge in the vicinity of Damascus and South Izra in the Daraa countryside.The attack killed at least 23 Syrian and allied Iranian fighters, according to war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Unconfirmed reports said the senior Syrian Maj Gen Ismail Badran, chief commander of Mezzeh airbase, was killed. Syrian state media reported eight injuries and no deaths.In July last year Damascus accused Israel of heinous aggression after strikes south of Damascus and in Homs province led to the deaths of at least six civilians.Syrias foreign ministry filed a complaint to the United Nations security council over the attack, demanding accountability, although the Observatory said the deaths could have occurred in the aftermath of the attack by the remnants of missile parts or the Syrian counter-attack itself.',\n",

Almost all the regions glaciers are melting.The Esperanza reading breaks the record for the Antarctic continent. The record for the Antarctic region  that is, everywhere south of 60 degrees latitude  is 19.8C, taken on Signy Island in January 1982.Prof James Renwick, a climate scientist at Victoria University of Wellington, was a member of an ad-hoc World Meteorological Organization committee that has verified previous records in Antarctica.He told Guardian Australia it was likely the committee would be reconvened to check the new Esperanza record.He said: Of course the record does need to be checked, but pending those checks, its a perfectly valid record and that [temperature] station is well maintained.The reading is impressive as its only five years since the previous record was set and this is almost one degree centigrade higher. Its a sign of the warming that has been happening there thats much faster than the global average.To have a new record set that quickly is surprising but who knows how long that will last? Possibly not that long at all.He said the temperature record at Esperanza was one of the longest-running on the whole continent.The Argentine research base Esperanza, on the northern tip of #Antarctic Peninsula, saw a new record temperature of 18.3C today (old one 17.5C on 24 March 2015), per @SMN_Argentina. Details of previous record at https://t.co/19Un83mmHn#ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/ZKvzr765AmRenwick said higher temperatures in the region tended to coincide with strong northwesterly winds moving down mountain slopes  a feature of the weather patterns around Esperanza in recent days.He said there were complex weather patterns in the area, but the Esperanza reading was likely a combination of natural variability and background warming caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.He said: The reason the peninsula is warming faster than other places is a combination of natural variations and warming signals.Prof Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, has carried out research at James Ross Island at the northern tip of the peninsula.Its an area thats warming very quickly, she said, adding it can occasionally be warm enough to wear a T-shirt.Previous research from 2012 found the current rate of warming in the region was almost unprecedented over the past 2000 years.Abram said: Even small increases in warming can lead to large increases in the energy you have for melting the ice. The consequences are the collapse of the ice shelves along the peninsula.Meltwater can work its way through cracks in ice shelves, she said. Because ice shelves already float on the ocean, their collapse does not directly contribute to rising sea levels.But Abram said the shelves acted as plugs, helping to keep the ice sheets behind them stable. Melting of ice sheets does contribute to rising sea levels because they are attached to land.Dr Steve Rintoul, a leading oceanographer and Antarctic expert at CSIRO, said: This is a record from only a single station, but it is in the context of whats happening elsewhere and is more evidence that as the planet warms we get more warm records and fewer cold records.The lowest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica  and anywhere on Earth  was at the Russian Vostok station, when temperatures dropped to -89.2C on 21 July 1983.',\n",

At the current fiscal stance, the regions existing financial wealth could be depleted in the next 15 years, it said. The Washington-based international crisis lender said global oil demand could peak by around 2040 or much sooner in case of a stronger regulatory push for environmental protection and energy efficiency. All GCC countries have recognized the lasting nature of their challenge ... However, the expected speed and size of these consolidations in most countries may not be sufficient to stabilize their wealth. Gulf states have for decades used their energy wealth to provide millions of citizens with government jobs, part of a social contract by rulers that rewards political acquiescence and educational attainment with employment for life. But high-paying public sector jobs that demand little of workers have translated into low productivity and an entitlement culture, as well as rising costs as populations grow. Budgets are stretched further by hefty state spending on subsidies, social services and generous state pensions. GCC governments have only gradually introduced austerity measures to avoid social discontent, such as the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) in some GCC countries. But most continue to struggle to balance fiscal consolidation and growth.  The IMF said the introduction of VAT and excise taxes was positive: There is significant potential to build on this progress. As the region transitions toward a non-hydrocarbon economy, moving from wide-ranging fees toward fewer broad-based taxes, for example, could provide much-needed revenue diversification. Kuwait - which has one of the worlds biggest sovereign funds - could need some $180 billion in financing over the next six years in the absence of more drastic fiscal measures, the IMF said last month. Saudi Arabia, the Arab worlds largest economy and the worlds largest crude exporter, expects a deficit of $50 billion this year, up from $35 billion in 2019.

       " 'New Delhi:It has been a week since the trio of Madan Lal, R.P. Singh and Sulakshana Naik were appointed the new Cricket Advisory Committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but they are yet to get the terms of reference that they would need when they sit down to pick the next batch of national selectors after the terms of chief selector M.S.K. Prasad and Gagan Khoda ended.Speaking to IANS, Lal said that he did have a chat with the board officials after the appointment, but he is yet to get the guidelines from the BCCI when it comes to the pointers that need to be followed while appointing selectors for the two empty posts.\"I did have a word with them after the appointment, but I am yet to receive any terms of reference with the appointment of the national selectors,\" he said.The CAC is expected to pick the two selectors in time for the selection of the squad for the ODI series against South Africa that gets underway on March 12.While the name of former pacer Ajit Agarkar is doing the rounds for the post of chief selector, Lal said that clarity on the matter will only be reached after they get the terms of reference.\"I cannot say for now if Agarkar can be picked since Jatin Paranjpe is already there representing the West Zone. I can only speak on that once I get the guidelines on the process of selection,\" he said.While the zonal system doesn\\'t apply anymore, Agarkar coming in would mean that the Central Zone would go unrepresented because Khoda was representing the zone and the selectors who will continue are from North (Sarandeep Singh), West (Paranjpe) and East (Devang Gandhi). The South Zone was being represented by Prasad and he will be replaced in all probability by Laxman Sivaramakrishnan.Another issue that was a major bone of contention while picking the CAC was the Conflict of Interest clause of the new constitution of the BCCI. But Lal said that he had made it clear that he wouldn\\'t be giving up his involvement in developing the next generation of cricketers through his academy.\"The conflict clause needs a re-look at the earliest if you want the best to come back and get involved in administration. I had made it clear that I will not quit coaching kids because that then leads to you giving up on you earning bread for your family and that is not right. I was very honest when giving a declaration and I have no conflict,\" he explained.',\n",
       " 'A tearful Naomi Osaka followed up her Australian Open disappointment with another surprise defeat on Friday when she was beaten 6-0, 6-3 by world number 78 Sara Sorribes Tormo in the Fed Cup.  Spain took an unexpected 1-0 lead over Japan in the tie in Cartagena after Sorribes Tormo capitalised on a careless performance from Osaka, who made an astonishing 50 unforced errors in the 15 games. Sorribes Tormo enjoyed the backing of a sizeable home crowd at La Manga Club and her consistency proved too much for Osaka, who has never played her best on clay. We knew that Sara had the game to make it very uncomfortable for Naomi, Spain captain Anabel Medina Garrigues said. She stuck to the game plan perfectly. Osaka, a two-time Grand Slam champion, has endured a shaky start to the year after being knocked out by 15-year-old American sensation Coco Gauff last month in Melbourne, where she had lifted the trophy in 2019. Yet since claiming her second consecutive major triumph, Osaka has dipped, failing to go past the fourth round in any of the four Grand Slams since.  The 22-year-old, who has dropped to number 10 in the world, surrendered the first set to Sorribes Tormo in a swift 27 minutes before putting up more of a fight in the second. But after leading 2-0, Sorribes Tormo came back and a break midway through proved decisive, with a clearly disappointed Osaka struggling to contain her emotions at the finish.  Sorribes Tormos second career singles win in Fed Cup puts Spain in a strong position ahead of the second singles rubber between Carla Suarez Navarro and Misaki Doi later on Friday.',\n",

This was an offer which was made to all our neighbours but only seven nationals of Maldives chose to avail the offer, Jaishankar said.Coronavirus originated in China in December, last year, and has since then killed 636 people in that country alone, while cases have been registered in several countries across the world, including India.(The story has been published from a wire feed without any modifications to the text, only the headline has been changed.)',\n",

Today, we have to take a pledge to strengthen Vikas and Vishwas and now to allow violence again in this land, he said.Modi also said after so many decades of violence there is peace in the region now.In New India, I welcome peaceful northeast. A new era of peace and development is historical in the northeast. This has happened when India is celebrating 150 years of birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and signifies his path of non-violence, he said.All demand related to the Bodo issues have been met.

       " 'Zareen Khan has made a splash on the small screen with a travel show, which has her exploring locations where iconic Bollywood films have been shot. In an interview with Hindustan Times, the actor gets candid about her television debut, her glamorous image and trolling.Excerpts:Q. Tell us about your new show.A. My show, AXNs Jeep Bollywood Trails, mixes two of my passions  travel and films. Very few people know that I am an avid and passionate traveller. Whenever I have the slightest opportunity, I just take off somewhere, be it a road trip or just going away for the weekend. I could not have asked for a better TV debut than this because it feels like a custom-made show for me, where I am travelling all across India and actually going to these iconic locations which have been used in blockbuster films shot by 10 top directors. They have spoken to us about their experiences of shooting their films in these locations. Q. You have mentioned earlier that you were offered several TV shows in the past, including Bigg Boss. Why did you turn Bigg Boss down?A. Bigg Boss is honestly not my cup of tea. It is a game that really tests your patience and tolerance levels. I am not somebody who is okay with being disrespected. Sometimes, people in the house tend to be very disrespectful towards each other. I am religiously following this season and even though there is a lot of entertainment, there are really nasty abuses and physical fights. I dont think I can tolerate that. I am a no-nonsense person and if anyone talks nonsense with me, I would just slap that person and get out of the house. If I am going to be evicted in such a manner, why should I be a part of a show like that?Also read: Zareen Khan recalls how a director once wanted her to rehearse a kissing scene to let go of her inhibitionsQ. You are playing a lesbian in your upcoming film Hum Bhi Akele Tum Bhi Akele. Do you think the portrayal of homosexuality in Bollywood has evolved?A. Definitely, cinema is evolving towards the LGBTQ community and I am very happy to see actors being fearless and picking up such roles. Some years back, a homosexual character was used in our films only as a joke or someone to be made fun of, which was so wrong and so insensitive. I dont know why they were treated different because they have the same flesh, blood, emotions. Why the discrimination? I am very happy that finally, we are in a day and age where they have the courage to openly come out and express themselves. Q. Is a film like Hum Bhi Akele Tum Bhi Akele a conscious departure from your glamorous image?A. I realised that somehow because of the image that I have in the industry, I wasnt getting to do the kind of roles that I really wanted to do even if I approached people. I was considered a glamorous actor, but I dont want to live with that image. Its good, but I want to show that I am an actor. The industry holds a very different perception about acting and I have been told that Oh, in our industry, there is a notion that pretty girls cant act and only girls who are not-so-good-looking are great actors. Honestly, that didnt make sense to me. So yes, that has been my struggle in this industry and I did take a conscious decision of staying away from films that just show me as glamorous, eye candy or show my body more than my acting.Finally, Hum Bhi Akele Tum Bhi Akele happened. Even its makers were not convinced that I can do the role despite giving me a narration. A lot of convincing went into it; they wanted the character not to wear any makeup. I have also put on weight for the role. The film and my performance is being appreciated at film festivals around the world. I am now waiting for the film to release in theatres in India.Q. Apart from your bitter experience with Aksar 2 where the script and costume was tweaked at the last minute, have you faced any setback because of your glamorous image?A. That was one bad experience. I trusted the makers and they promised to make a clean film during narration. However, once we started shooting, the brief of the clothes changed and every other scene had me kissing my co-star. The film had to be completed but I did put my foot down and ensured I wasnt exploited. Q. You have talked about being the target of trolling and body-shaming. Does it still bother you?A. Trolling never bothers me. There are so many times when I dont even pay attention to it. Yes, certain times, you should give it back to them because it is necessary. But you cant be giving them so much attention every time because if you do, then they keep doing it just to get attention. Also, I feel that trolls are people I have a lot of empathy towards, especially because you are writing negative things under a fake profile. If you had the guts to say whatever you are saying, then you would write it with your own identity. I think these people are really suppressed in reality, frustrated and dont have a say in anything in their life. This is their way of venting out and trying to get some attention on social media under a fake profile. What could be bad about these people?Q. For the most part, celebrities either tend to stay silent or give a rather measured response to the current political climate. Why do you think that is?A. It is an individuals opinion. People who want to talk about it are definitely coming out and talking about it. I read Anurag Kashyap, Pooja Bhatt and Richa Chadhas tweets. They are all out there and really speaking their minds. There are some people who choose not to do it. I dont think you can actually pinpoint and say that this one is talking measured or not. Its every persons choice. Yes, with the situation that is going on in the country, everyone should have a say in this. But you cant force anybody and to each, his own. If someone chooses not to speak about it, that is their choice.Q. What are your upcoming projects?A. I am really looking forward to the release of Hum Bhi Akele Tum Bhi Akele. It is a film that is made for the audiences. It has already received so much appreciation and I really want our audiences to watch it and embrace the message that we are trying to give through the film. I have two Punjabi films, my web debut with a strong, woman-oriented show, a horror film in Hindi and I am in talks for projects in Telugu. So, its quite a mixed bag. I am really looking forward to doing to some good work this year.Follow@htshowbiz for more',\n",

       " 'Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted as the coronavirus crisis continues.The Taiwanese companys production lines have been shut down because of the disruption caused by the outbreak, slowing down the supply chain that feeds Apples global retail network.However, in a statement released via the Chinese social media platform WeChat, Foxconn said it hoped to get around the problem by switching some of its own production lines to make masks, for its own staff and to supply the soaring global demand for them.The virus is officially calledSars-CoV-2 and this causes the disease Covid-19. It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples  severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus can causepneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Chinas national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outsideChina, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend.There are nine cases of the virus in the UK. Four were located in Brighton, one in London. At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative. Of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.We dont yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we wont know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about400,000 deathseach year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. TheNHS advisesthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GPs surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is the worldwide spread of a disease. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHOs list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a window of opportunity to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Sarah BoseleyHealth editor andHannah DevlinIt hopes to increase production to 2m masks by the end of the month.In this war against the epidemic, every second counts, the company said.The earlier we take precautionary actions, the earlier we can prevent the virus, the earlier we can save lives, the sooner we can overcome this.Foxconn, which has previously come under scrutiny over poor conditions endured by workers making iPhones, said it had already begun a test run of masks at its main manufacturing plant in Shenzhen, southern China.They will initially be produced for internal use by its hundreds of thousands of employees, the majority of whom work in factories in mainland China.After that, it will begin supplying masks to the wider public, from whom soaring demand has caused shortages as people trying to protect themselves from the virus.Several other Chinese companies have said they will divert some of their production capacity to mask-making. They include the clothing firm Hongdou Group and the carmaker SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co Ltd, a joint-venture automaker formed by General Motors and two Chinese partners.The outbreak, which began in Wuhan, Hubei province, has claimed 636 lives in mainland China and infected more than 30,000 people.A number of multinational companies have said they expect significant disruption to their supply chains or their Chinese sales, while economists have predicted the virus will reduce output in China and nearby countries such as Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism from the country.',\n",
       " 'Torrential rain in New South Wales has reduced the number of active fires in the state by a third, from more than 60 down to 42, but parts of the east coast now face a new threat from flooding, with Sydney facing one of its wettest three-day periods in years.The commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons, said on Friday there had been a dramatic shift in the hot, dry and windy conditions that have driven the unprecedented fire season for months.This has been an absolute welcome disruption to that weather pattern and a massive reprieve and relief to so many people right across New South Wales, he said.Obviously we dont want to see lots of widespread damage and destruction from flooding, but it is certainly a welcome change to the relentless campaign of hot, dry weather resulting in widespread damaging, destructive fires that weve experienced for too long now.The RFS is taking advantage of the conditions to strengthen containment lines and, where possible, conduct back-burning operations.Fitzsimmons said of the 42 fires still burning in NSW, 17 were uncontained. He said there was optimism that rainfall over the next week would result in many of those being declared contained, and hopefully going to the status of out.The largest effect has been on fires in the north and north-east of the state.Its certainly not across all the fire grounds at this stage. Weve seen it concentrated largely up through the north-east of the state, it is slowly moving south-eastwards toward Sydney and parts of the Illawarra, Fitzsimmons said.Coastal areas of NSW, including Sydney, could receive their highest rainfall levels in more than three years as a trough makes its way down the state.Multiple severe weather and flood warnings were in place across NSW on Friday, with emergency services warning of possible land slips in areas near fire grounds cleared of vegetation.Not sure Wakehurst Parkway should still be open? #sydneyrain pic.twitter.com/9my5SHpp09The Bureau of Meteorology said on Friday could see Sydney receive its largest amount of rainfall over a 24-hour period since 2018, with 60mm to 90mm forecast. Totals as high as 200mm were forecast for Saturday, and 150mm for Sunday.The last time the city had more than 100mm of rain in one day was 28 November 2018.The city could also receive more rainfall over a three-day period than it has has at any point in the past three and a half years, with as much as 120-150mm forecast for Saturday and another 90-150mm expected on Sunday.The last three-day event when we saw rainfall totals potentially this high was 226mm and that was in June 2016, Dean Sgarbossa, a senior meteorologist, said.The heavy falls are due to a trough that is making its way from south-east Queensland and northern NSW down the coast. The bureau warned conditions were likely to develop into an east coast low, which can be characterised by destructive winds, torrential rainfall and rough seas.Mitchell Harley, a coastal researcher at the University of NSW, said 5.5m waves forecast for high tide on Sunday morning in Sydney could potentially replicate conditions similar to the 2016 east coast low, when parts of houses in the northern beaches suburb of Collaroy were destroyed and large sections of the beach were washed away.In Newcastle, 45 tonnes of sand were brought in to protect Stockton beach, the ABC reported. The beach has suffered dramatic erosion in recent years, forcing the closure of a childcare centre and threatening other beachside buildings.Within the trough there are smaller low pressure centres that are leading to intense rainfall over some areas. The BoM said the small scale of these low pressure centres was making precise forecasting of rainfall levels in some areas difficult.The heavy falls are expected to move into fire-affected parts of the NSW south coast over the weekend. There could also be significant falls in areas with active fires near the ACT and in Victorias East Gippsland region.But those heavy falls come with warnings of water contamination from ash and silt.Increased run-off could also lead to flash flooding and land slips, which may block access trails and roads in some areas.WaterNSW has been monitoring areas around the Warragamba Dam, the source of 80% of untreated supply for greater Sydney.Two silt curtains designed to trap material that could pose a risk to water quality have been in place since January.On Friday WaterNSW said the Warragamba catchment was expected to receive 200mm of rain over the weekend, but the advice from the Bureau of Meteoroglogy was that rain would not be at such a level as to raise major concerns about water quality in the Warragamba dam storage.Were really pleased to see #sydneyrain falling across our catchment. Please remember to continue to save water in your home and that severe water restrictions are in place. pic.twitter.com/mUnm748aFPHowever some debris/ash is likely to be transported into the storage.The chief executive of WaterNSW, David Harris, said the organisation had sophisticated models that could predict what was coming into water storages. He said the full impact would be clearer in coming days.Managing water quality in our dam storages is what we as an organisation do, and our water quality scientists are highly-regarded experts. Some debris/ash is likely to be transported into the storage, but we are well-placed to manage the risk, he said.Brogo dam, on the south coast, which supplies Bermagui, is also close to a fire ground.On Friday, the flooding led to road closures in some areas, including several in Sydney.In the northern rivers region, a car was washed off the road and two people had to be rescued from a caravan due to rising floodwaters.The road to the Jenolan Caves, south-west of Katoomba, was also closed due to fears the heavy rain could cause landslides.The RFS said there were still some areas west of the ranges around Canberra, where a number of fires were burning and yet to see rainfall.Crews were back-burning where possible, but very heavy rain could make that difficult in some places.However, Fitzsimmons said the wet weather was putting much needed moisture back into the landscape and this would help firefighting efforts, even if hot, dry weather returned.Were certainly not going to have the underlying conditions of such profound moisture deficit and drought situations dominated by this massive heat event thats been sitting there literally for months, he said.',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Hong Kong Airlines said on Friday that it will slash 400 jobs and cut operations given weak travel demand because of the coronavirus outbreak, adding to financial woes for the citys second-largest carrier.  The South China Morning Post first reported about the airlines plans to cut about 10% of its workforce. As uncertainty looms with the evolving nature of this global issue, weak travel demand will likely continue into the summer season and we need to take further action to stay afloat, an airline spokesman said in an email to Reuters.   There has never been a more challenging time in Hong Kong Airlines history as of now. These decisions are difficult but had to be made to keep the airline alive, he added. Several airlines have suspended flights to China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The flu-like coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person and has infected more than 31,000 and claimed 636 lives so far on the mainland. It has spread globally, with 320 cases in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, according to a Reuters tally of official statements. Hong Kong Airlines, part owned by cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], said it will reduce its daily operations to 30 from 82 sectors over Feb. 11 to March.  It also said its Hong Kong-based ground staff will be asked to take a minimum of two weeks unpaid leave per month, or switch to working three days a week between Feb. 17 and June 30. Larger rival Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) has already asked employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, saying preserving cash was key and conditions were as grave as during the 2009 financial crisis due to the virus outbreak. Both Cathay and Hong Kong Airlines have been grappling with a sharp fall in demand since the middle of 2019 due to widespread, sometimes violent, anti-government protests in the Chinese-controlled territory. Hong Kong Airlines has also been battling other financial woes. In December, it was forced to draw up plans to raise money as it faced the possibility of a license suspension by the citys air transport regulator.

       " 'NEW DELHI :Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), Indias largest electric vehicle maker by sales volume, is exploring partnerships with global manufacturers to jointly develop electric vehicles and their powertrains, managing director Pawan Goenka said.This will include a potential stake sale in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mahindra Electric, Goenka said in an interview on Thursday.Unlike rivals, M&M has made its electric vehicle (EV) business a separate unit and has also set up a base for developing and manufacturing such vehicles and components on the outskirts of Bengaluru.Goenka said the global sales volume for EVs is still low, while the number of companies entering the segment is fairly large, which includes traditional automakers as well as startups.Therefore, collaboration will be the key in powertrain, which means the battery, the motor, power electronics and the charger. Thats the reason we have set up Mahindra Electric as a separate company, but now we have started to see how we can get strategic partners, so that we can pool in our volumes and create an electric powertrain supply company,\" he said, adding that the company would function like a consortium of manufacturers.We are talking to various OEMs who are interested, take equity in Mahindra Electric and become partners,\" Goenka said.He said the EV business was still at an early stage. Right now everybody is in a pilot phase and if am selling 100 vehicles (EVs) per month at a loss, then I can afford it. It will get lost in my remaining 15,000 vehicles but then if I am selling 10,000 vehicles, then I cannot afford to sell at a loss.\"M&M has a track record of partnering competing carmakers to develop products and platforms. In the 1990s, it tied up with Ford Motor Co. as well as French automaker Renault SA, though both the partnerships were later shelved.In October last year, Ford and M&M signed an agreement to form a joint venture in which the Anand Mahindra-led firm owns 51% and Fords local unit owns the rest. Under the arrangement, Ford agreed to transfer its entire business in India, barring an engine plant in Sanand, Gujarat, and its Chennai-based Global Business Services unit to a new joint venture company.I think its important to have that partnership to make electric vehicles commercially viable. Second partnership (after powertrain) will be at the platform level and OEMs who have developed a very well-engineered platform and they are opening that platform to others to license. Third will be sharing a product under different company names,\" Goenka said.M&M plans to supply and export EV powertrains to other EV producers. On Wednesday, the company launched its latest offering in the EV space, eKUV at the Auto Expo, at a starting price of  8.25 lakh (ex-showroom).',\n",

He told me he had done it in the past. He told me that ragging takes place in engineering colleges, and he was given a task to kiss four boys. I feel this is ridiculous. I feel ragging should be banned and it is not right. It shouldn\\'t happen. It wasn\\'t banned back then, so Jitu had to do it. So, he has done method acting before this film,\" said Ayushmann, while interacting with students at Bhavan\\'s College to promote Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, along with his co-actor Jitendra Kumar in Mumbai.On the release of the gay rom-com Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, Ayushmaan said he is glad that India is ready is for a film on same-sex relationships.Talking about audience response to the film\\'s trailer and songs, Ayushmann said: \"I feel glad and I am pretty sure that India is ready for this kind of films now.

       " 'Manish Natverlal Shah, a general practitioner, was on Friday given three life sentences for 90 sex assaults on female patients while working in London, when he carried out invasive examinations for sexual gratification.Shah, 50, who gained his medical qualifications from the University of London in 1993, mentioned health issues of celebrities such as Angeline Jolie and Jade Goody as examples to frighten patients between 2009 and 2013, the high court of England and Wales was told.Judge Anne Molyneux described him as a master of deception who abused his position of power. You made up stories which got into heads and caused panic. Your behaviour was not only sexual but was driven by your desire to control and on occasions humiliate women.Shah, who worked as a GP in Romford, east London, recommended that the patients have regular breast and vaginal examinations, when there was no clinical need. He highlighted the urgency of check-ups for cervical cancer, breast cancer and other illnesses.The court was told that Shah was over familiar with some of his female patients, and made inappropriate comments as well as making physical contact and hugging and kissing them.Paul Goddard, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: Manish Shah was a trusted family doctor, but he took advantage of that trust to abuse his female patients and then falsified their medical notes to try to justify intimate medical examinations that should not have taken place.The Crown Prosecution Service wishes to commend those women, who by bravely giving evidence convinced the jury of Dr Shahs guilt.Also read | Indian-origin doctor used cancer fears to sexually assault women in UK: CopsShah was first arrested in September 2013.At an earlier trial in 2018, he was convicted of offences relating to 18 other people, bringing the total number of offences to 90 relating to 23 patients.Lawyer for Shah, Zoe Johnson, said: It goes without saying that all of these women feel grossly abused, humiliated, and that the trust that they placed in Manish Shah has been so dreadfully exploited. He deeply regrets hurting them and cannot say sorry enough.Richard McDonagh of Scotland Yard said: Shah was a long-serving doctor who was well-known in the community, and trusted and liked by his patients, many who had him as their GP for many years.They were unaware that Shah was carrying out unnecessary, invasive examinations on female patients for his own sexual gratification, after giving his victims misleading clinical advice. These offences are particularly grave due to Shahs abuse of his position, and of the trust placed in him as a family doctor.',\n",
       " 'The Maharashtra government on Thursday informed Bombay High Court more than Rs 700 crore was disbursed to thousands of non-teaching staff of six universities in the state fraudulently. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the bench of justice SC Dharmadhikari and justice RI Chagla that under the guise of changing the nomenclature of certain posts, the pay scale of several non-teaching posts was increased and salaries were drawn accordingly after fraudulently obtaining approvals to the proposals.What we have discovered is a fraud on the state exchequer. This has happened in the case of six universities, Kumbhakoni said.According to an affidavit filed by the higher and technical education department, thousands of non-teaching staff members of Savitribai Phule Pune University, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Shivaji University, Kolhapur, North Maharashtra University at Jalgaon, Sant Gadgebaba University, Amravati and Gondwana University at Gadchiroli have taken undue benefit under the fraud.Kumbhakoni said after the state government decided to introduce a new staffing pattern in 2014, these universities sent their proposals for changing the nomenclature of several non-teaching posts to a certain desk officer in the higher and technical education department.The desk officer obtained approvals from higher-ups to the proposals on the ground that there would be no additional financial burden and because of that, no approval of the finance department was obtained.The universities not only changed the posts nomenclature but also increased the pay-scale for them. The non-teaching staff and their duties remained unchanged but they started getting higher pay scales, said the advocate general. He added the matter did not stop at that and several employees drew additional amounts running into lakhs of rupees towards arrears, he added.The total excess amount paid is over Rs 700 crore, he added.He was responding to a bunch of petitions filed by bodies representing employees of Pune and Shivaji universities and some individuals, challenging the December 17, 2018, government resolution (GR) issued by the higher and technical education department under which a squad was appointed to probe the matter and recover the excess dues.The GR was issued after the finance department, in October 2017, realised that there was something wrong in the way salaries to non-teaching staff at the six universities were being disbursed after employees of other varsities started demanding higher pay scale at par with them, and asked the higher and technical education department to investigate the matter.The investigating squad submitted its interim report recently revealing how the fraud was perpetrated by giving a go by to the prevailing procedure  to seek approval of the finance department to every proposal involving financial implications  and how excess amounts have been drawn from the state exchequer.The court has posted the petitions for further hearing on Friday when it is likely to appoint an independent authority to hear the beneficiary university employees and submit a report suggesting course for further action.',\n",

After a row erupted, Issac defended the picture by saying the country wont forget Bapus killers. Yes, we remember Mahathma was murdered. We will not forget who murdered Gandhiji. He was murdered by Hindu communalists and many in the ruling party still rever them, he said.The image shows the father of the nation lying in a pool of blood as mourning supporters surround him. Issac said it was a painting by an artist from the state and its depiction was more relevant now as an attempt was being made to rewrite the history of the country.This is important at the time when history is being re-written.

       " 'A Delhi court has dismissed Tihar Jail  request to grant a fresh date of execution through the issuance of a death warrant for the four convicts facing execution in the Delhi gang rape and murder case on Friday.While hearing the arguments, the court sought to know from Tihar authorities, how they presumed that no plea will be filed by Pawan Gupta, one of the four convicts, within the one-week deadline granted on February 5 by the Delhi High Court.It observed that the death warrants cant be issued merely on the basis of surmise and conjecture.The petitioner told the court that since Pawan had not filed any legal challenge since 2018 when his review petition was dismissed by the SC, it was unlikely that he would file one now.The court didnt agree and said it upholds the right to legal remedies for all the convicts in a telling statement.Its criminally sinful to condemn the convicts when the law permits them to live, it observed.Tihar jail authorities had sought a fresh date of execution for the four convicts in the infamous Delhi gang rape and murder case of 2012 citing dismissal of mercy petitions of three convicts by the President of India and absence of any pending application by the convicts before courts.The defence counsel, however, called the application premature in the view of the February 5 Delhi High Court verdict that had given the convicts a weeks time to exhaust their legal remedies before authorities could decide on the next step.The Tihar jail authorities had argued that it would be fitting for the court to fix a new date for execution keeping the HC deadline in mind.Pawan Gupta is the only convict who has not yet filed a curative petition which is the last legal remedy available to him, after which he has the option of filing a mercy plea before the President of India.The trial court had first issued black warrants on January 7 and fixed January 22 as the day for execution, which was later postponed to February 1 and later postponed indefinitely.The case pertains to brutal gang-rape and the subsequent murder of a 22-year-old physiotherapy intern in a moving bus on the night of December 16, 2012, in south Delhi.Six people including the four convicts, Ram Singh and a juvenile -- were named as accused in the case.The trial of the five adults began in a fast-track court in March 2013 and Ram Singh allegedly committed suicide soon after in Tihar Jail, while Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan were sentenced to death in September 2013.',\n",
       " 'Kerala is ageing faster than the rest of India with regard to demographic transition in the Economic Review 2019, tabled by Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac in the state Assembly on Thursday.In 1961, Keralas 60 plus population was 5.1 per cent, which was just below the national level of 5.6 per cent. Since 1980, Kerala has overtaken the rest of India and in 2001 the proportion of the old age population rose to 10.5 per cent as against all India average of 7.5 per cent. By 2011, 12.6 per cent of Keralas population is past 60 years, compared to the all India average of 8.6 per cent. By 2015, population data show that it increased to 13.1 per cent in Kerala against the all India average of 8.3 per cent (SRS Statistical Report 2015). Currently, 48 lakh people (projected figures of the population in 2018) of Kerala are 60 years and above; 15 per cent of them are past 80 years, the fastest-growing group among the old, says Economic Review.Women outnumber men among the 60 plus and among them, the majority are widows. Kerala has got the highest life expectancy at birth of 72.5 years and 77.8 years for males and females respectively as per the SRS Report 2013-17.Listing the factors for the high old-age population Economic Review points out,Generally, life expectancy among women is higher than men at the all-India level also, however, it is much higher in Kerala. General improvement in health care facilities is one of the main reasons for the continuing increase in the proportion of the population of senior citizens.Men marrying women a few years younger is another cause for the high proportion of widows among the old. It is a worrisome revelation that National Sample Survey (NSS) 2015 had found that 65 per cent of the aged population is affected by morbidity.A large proportion of old age people in Kerala are widows. As per Census 2011, among the old age in the range of 60-69, 23 per cent are widows and among those above 70 years, it is 43.06 per cent. By 2025, about 20 per cent of the population would be elderly and the consequent demand on the social security system would be substantial, says Economic Review. ',\n",

It was a disciplined bowling effort by Melbourne Stars as Rauf, Nathan Coulter-Nile (2) and Adam Zampa (2) were all among the wickets.Melbourne Star will now take on Sydney Sixers in the final. Stoinis has had a major role to play in the Thunder reaching the final as he is the highest run-getter so far having amassed 695 runs from 16 matches at 57. 92. Despite playing less matches, Rauf is undeniably one of the superstars, having claimed 20 wickets in just 9 matches.\",\n",

       " \"Nanital:An incident that has raised concerns among several officials, a group of tigers of the Corbett Tiger Reserve were spotted chewing on a plastic drum within the limits of the Dhikala range during the final week of January.The pictures of the incident were clicked by some tourists and on January 30, they handed it over to the authorities at the CTR. The officials mentioned that a tigress, along with her cubs, got a hold of a plastic drum in the waters of the Ramganga river and in the pictures, they are seen chewing on it.According toThe Times of India,the tiger reserve is a plastic-free zone and even the tourists are not permitted to carry plastic products inside the reserve. It has shocked the administration and the concerned authorities have launched an investigation to find out how the container reached the reserved. Pondering beyond the authorities shock, the presence of the plastic container clearly exposes the status of the security of the protected area.Reportedly, the authorities, as a precautionary measure, have placedthe concerned tigers under a watch to trace any change in their behavior.Nothing. Few #tigers playing with #plastic they just received as a gift from us & delivered by this river at #Corbett. That is how deep into #forests & #oceans this plastic menace is growing. Hundreds of wildlife is dying because of them. Picture by Trikansh Sharma. Do we care. pic.twitter.com/dHE58YarjvAccording to the reports, Chandrashekhar Joshi, deputy director of CTR, said that there is a requirement to investigate all the angles ranging from the negligence of the workers to plotting by poachers. Further, he added that they have sent an alert to the forest officials of the hill districts and have urged them to ensure that no solid waste material is dumped near the rivers.International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed tiger as endangered species and is mentioned on the IUCN Red List. They are regarded as one of the most endangered animals on the planet. Their extinction will have huge implications on the ecosystem that they inhabit as they occupy the top consumer position in the food chain. They regulate the population of herbivores and a fall in their population could potentially lead to the collapse of the ecosystem.The government of India, in April 1973, launched an ambitions flagship programme called Project Tiger to protect the big wild cat from extinction. National Tiger Conservation Authority was tasked with the administration of the project. The project laid a strong emphasis on conserving the tiger's habitat and ensure the safety of the wild cat.It is believed, that owing to the measures taken under the project, the tiger population in India has witnessed a rise.In 1976, India gave a nod to this treaty. CITES is an international agreement between governments and aims at ensuring that international trade in specimens of wild fauna (animals) and flora (plants) is not a threat to their survival. Tigers are protected under CITES.Despite, so many initiatives to protect the wild tigers, the big cat still faces threats such as shrinking habitat and illegal poaching, conflict with the neighbouring villagers and pollution, among others. Reportedly, traditional Chinese medicines use parts of a tiger such as their bones are used for manufacturing medicines that relieve body pain. Tigerskin is also used for decorative purposes and this has led to illegal hunting.\",\n",

       " 'Australias eight most prominent universities have dismissed media reports that they are planing to quarantine international students on regional campuses as a result of the federal governments travel ban.Since 1 February foreign nationals have been barred from entering Australia within 14 days of leaving China, as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak.On Friday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Australian universities were drawing up plans to quarantine thousands of international students on regional campuses or in student accommodation to reduce disruption to the start of semester.The University of Sydneys campus in Camden, 50km from its main site, was listed as a potential site.But Vicki Thompson, the chief executive of the Group of Eight (Go8), told Guardian Australia this was not under consideration by its universities.The Go8 comprises the University of Sydney, UNSW, ANU, the University of Melbourne, Monash, the University of Queensland, the University of Adelaide and the University of WA.A spokeswoman for the University of Sydney said it had no plans to use our Camden campus for isolation purposes.Under the current travel restrictions, any student who had left China and had been outside the country for 14 days without showing symptoms would not need to be further quarantined.International students contributed $34bn to the Australian economy last year, and the sector faces major losses from students cancelling enrolments.The travel ban has left nearly 100,000 Chinese  students with valid visas stranded outside Australia, according to the latest figures from the Department of Home Affairs. Almost 59,000 Chinese international students are in Australia.As of Friday, there had been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus across Australia, of which five people had recovered.Many universities have extended the deadline to enrol for the first semester, or to defer studies for a semester, or are offering online classes.On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told Radio National there might be opportunities for some of the universities to provide quarantine for those Chinese students who are coming to Australia  but did not mention regional campuses.On Friday, the Go8 said it was implementing other measures to minimise the disruption to study.Thompson said where possible semester one programs could join seamlessly to semester two programs, especially for students close to completing their degrees.Monash University has pushed back the start date of the semester by a week, while more than 4,000 students at the University of Sydney signed a petition to delay theirs by a fortnight.The University of Sydney said it had arranged temporary accommodation for the small number of students living in student accommodation that need to self-isolate.Financial analysts Moodys said on Friday that the financial hit of coronavirus and travel restrictions would be manageable if it was contained within the next few months.But it noted that Australian universities were more dependent on international students from China than other OECD countries.Among the Go8, 60% of international student enrolments are from China, and they represent 40% across all universities.If coronavirus is quickly contained  meaning within several months  the effect on Australian universities is likely to be manageable, with revenue deferred (not lost) and no change to credit quality, Moodys said.However, if the current outbreak is not contained quickly, the revenue effect and drawdown of cash reserves has the potential to be significant.The co-secretary of the NSW branch of the National Tertiary Education Union, Michael Thomson, said academics and teachers were worried by universities confusing responses to the ban.There is concern that university authorities are not being completely clear about what is happening, he said. Putting something back two weeks  does that mean a 13-week semester becomes an 11-week semester?In a sense the concern is the unknown. Its almost like policy is being made on the hop.On Friday, the NSW NTEU and the University of Sydneys student representative council organised a protest against the travel ban.SRC president Liam Donohoe said earlier in the week the travel ban went against the advice of the World Health Organisation and led to international students losing out on learning, work, relationships and communities to the extent that they may never return.',\n",
       " 'Mumbai, Indias financial hub and the nations richest municipality, is exploring new ways to boost revenue as a slowing economy hurts earnings from real estate.This includes tax on garbage collection and additional levies on services such as issuing birth certificates. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, which covers half the area of the city of New York but houses 50% more people, sees revenue dropping 5% from its previous target to 238.5 billion rupees ($3.4 billion) in the year through March 31.Deteriorating finances in Mumbai -- whose budget is bigger than several Indian states -- bodes ill for Indias economic revival because local expenditure has a bigger impact than that by Prime Minister Narendra Modis administration. Every 1 rupee spent by states yields 1.07 rupees in extra output versus 0.4 for the federal government, according to a working paper published by the Reserve Bank of India.For now, Mumbai plans to increase spending by almost 9% in the year starting April 1, including on better storm-water drains to prevent flooding during the citys annual monsoon, and an ambitious and controversial coastal road that will hug the citys shoreline from Marine Lines  called the Queens Necklace  in the south to the crowded northern suburbs.Its unclear though how it will achieve that goal given tax collections on the sale of apartments and offices in Indias priciest property market missed the current-years target by 12%.Faced with a fall in revenues from the major sources of income, the corporation plans to adopt innovative measures for resource mobilization,\" Care Ratings economists, including Madan Sabnavis, wrote in a report. These include measures to recover outstanding dues of property tax and water tax by way of issuance of notices to defaulters, disconnection of water connections, attachments and auction of properties,\" they wrote.Mumbais municipal body expects income on its 786.7 billion rupees of investments to drop 11% due to lower bank interest rates in the next financial year. It also doesnt see any additional increase in compensation from the federal government. Until 2017, Mumbai earned a third of its income through octroi, or an entry levy, which was replaced with a nationwide goods and services tax after Modi promised to compensate for a portion of the reduction.Indias economic slowdown means the federal government hasnt been able to transfer the funds beyond September. The remainder will be issued in two tranches, junior finance minister Anurag Thakur told parliament Feb. 3.',\n",

His father does odd jobs while his mother is a homemaker.On January 31, he was playing outside his home when he went missing. His mother approached the police after which a kidnapping case was registered and the investigators began scanning CCTV footage, said DCPGaurav Sharma (outer north district).Footage from one of the cameras showed a woman taking away the child. We identified her as 28-year-old Rummy, who lives in the same neighbourhood, said the DCP.Rummy told police she had allegedly kidnapped the child at the behest of a man, Kapil, who lives in Hapur. The police went on to arrest Kapil and his wife and from them learnt that they had sold the child to a man on whose demand they had outsourced the work to Rummy. Kapil had been paid Rs 70,000 for this work, police said.That middleman is on the run, a reason why the police did not identify him for the media.But following the chain, the police reached a couple in Bulandshahar who had finally bought the child for Rs 4.5 lakh, the DCP said. While the husband remains on the run, the 50-year-old wife, Sunita, was arrested and the boy rescued at her instance on Tuesday.Another investigator said the couple had been wanting a healthy son.

Delhi will vote for a new government tomorrow.When the petition filed by Advocate Amit Sahni came up for hearing today, a bench of justices comprising Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph said that they will hear the matter on Monday next week. The lawyer for the petitioner pointed out that elections to Delhi will be over by then.Exactly why we are saying we will hear it on Monday, the bench said. Though the bench deferred the hearing, it acknowledged that there is a problem.The plea says that the road closure at Shaheen bagh causes great inconvenience to the public at large. The road closure and the consequent traffic diversion have led to the wastage of precious time, energy and fuel, besides overburdening the DND, Akshardham and Ashram routes.The Kalindi Kunj road, the petitioner argued, is a vital route since it connects three states  Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana  and the road closure has led to huge difficulties not only for the residents of the area but lakhs of commuters who are not able to use the road due to the blockade.The petitioner stated that while people have the right to protest, the same is subject to reasonable restrictions and protesters cannot be allowed to occupy public roads indefinitely.No one can be permitted to occupy the public road for any reason whatsoever under the pretext of peaceful protest and that too for indefinite period to make others suffer for the samethe fundamental right of the protesters do not exist in isolation in a watertight compartment. One fundamental right of a person may have to coexist in harmony with the exercise of another fundamental right by others, the petition said.The plea was rejected by the Delhi high court on January 14 which stated that it is the responsibility of the police to maintain law and order and court cannot issue directions to the police on how to handle agitation, protest or traffic at the place of protest. .

The tribunal issued a one-page order on Feb. 4 saying the ban was being stayed as it continues to hear the companys appeal. The order, a copy of which was seen by Reuters on Thursday, did not elaborate on the reasons. AB InBev continues to argue against the ban saying it must be quashed as the company was not given adequate notice beforehand, according to a source familiar with the matter. The next tribunal appeal hearing is on Feb. 25, the order said. An official from the Delhi government said it would continue to defend its ban order. New Delhi authorities had found that SABMiller, bought by AB InBev in 2016, used duplicate barcodes on beer bottles supplied to city retailers, allowing it to pay lower levies.  The Delhi tribunals stay order will come as a major relief for AB InBev, which was already battling a separate Indian antitrust probe concerning alleged beer price fixing by SABMiller and other companies. A spokesman for AB InBev India told Reuters the company was encouraged by the stay order, but added it would not comment further during the ongoing appeal process.  We are committed to operating with integrity and ethics and remain excited about our business in India, he added. AB InBev, whose beers include Budweiser and Hoegaarden, is the second biggest player in Indias $7 billion market, with a 17.5% share, IWSR Drinks Market Analysis estimates.

       " 'The Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday rejected all grounds put forth by Dawood Ibrahim aide Jabir Motiwala to challenge his extradition to the United States, where he is wanted for charges of money-laundering conspiracy, extortion and import drugs.Judge John Zani ruled that his extradition complies with human rights legislation, adding: I also find that there are no bars to this extradition as would intervene to prevent extradition. He sent the case to home secretary Priti Patel for a final decision.However, after the home secretarys decision, Motiwala is likely to apply for permission to appeal in the high court of England and Wales. He has to apply within 14 days of the decision and if the permission is granted, the extradition will be stayed until the appeal is heard.The judged noted: According to information set out in the (extradition) request, JM (Jabir Motiwala) is said to be an important member of an international criminal organisation called `D Company`, based in Pakistan, India and UAE.That organisation is said to have conducted criminal activities in the USA which include Drug Trafficking, Money Laundering and Blackmail, referring to the illegal activities of Indias most wanted, Dawood Ibrahim, who is wanted in India for several offences.Motiwala, who appeared in court via videolink from the Wandsworth prison, sat slumped in a chair as the judge handed down the judgement. He identified himself again in the court as Jabir Siddiq.Judge Zani said: When the defendant was arrested in London for these matters, he gave the name Jabir Siddiq. When he was asked by the arresting police officers whether he had ever used the name `Motiwala` he agreed that he had. However, at his initial appearance in this court he denied being Jabir Motiwala and has maintained that he was Jabir Siddiq.Rejecting grounds such as abuse of process and risk to human rights, the judge said he was also satisfied that US authorities would need to apply to UK authorities if they were to charge Motiwala of charges other than those made in the extradition request.Motiwalas defence team had raised the prospect of he being tried for terrorism offences once he extradited to the US. Doing so would breach the condition of specialty in the extradition laws, but Judge Zani ruled that he was satisfied with the assurances given by US authorities.He said: It is perhaps appropriate for me to state, at this juncture, that I am satisfied that were the US authorities to seek to charge JM with matters outside the scope of the offences for which extradition is ordered, it is aware of the need to make the appropriate application to the UK authorities. JM would have the right to challenge / make representations in relation thereto.The judgement quotes a statement from US authorities as stating that the mere mentioning in the indictment that Mr Motiwala was part of an organisation which had connections to a terror organisation would not in and of itself cause a terrorism enhancement to apply.It continues: The defendant has not been charged with a felony that involved a federal crime of terrorism. Nor is the Government aware of evidence that the charged crimes were intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism.',\n",

In the audio clip, which surfaced on social media on Thursday, Ehsan said that he escaped the confinement of Pakistani security agencies on January 11, claiming Pakistani forces failed to keep their promises made to him during his surrender in 2017.With the help of God, I succeeded to escape on January 11, 2020 from the confinement of the security forces, he is heard saying in the clip.It would be a big blow to Pakistan and its campaign to eradicate the remnants of Taliban if the clip is proved to be authentic.Without revealing his current location, Ehsan said that he would make a detail statement about the days of his confinement in the coming days as well as about his future plans.Malala, 22, the youngest Nobel Peace prize winner, was shot by a gunman for campaigning for female education in 2012 in Pakistans Swat Valley. Ehsan was also involved in the one of the most gruesome attacks on children anywhere in the world when 8-10 suicide attackers wearing paramilitary Frontier Corps uniforms on December 16, 2014 entered the Peshawars Army Public School and went from classroom-to-classroom shooting indiscriminately, killing 149 people including 132 students. Ehsan in the audio clip said that he surrendered to the Pakistani security agencies on February 5, 2017 under an agreement but the forces failed to keep their promise made before the surrender.I followed the agreement for about three years. But these shrewd security institutions put me in prison along with my children in violation of the agreement, he said, adding that he finally decided to flee from the forces.

       " 'In December, Pakistani horserider Usman Khan qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics  marking his countrys maiden appearance in equestrians individual eventing. Two months later, Usmans upcoming presence at the Games has become a cause of concern among Indias Olympics administrators.The reason is that Usmans horse, the one he rode to qualify for Tokyo, is named Azad Kashmir (Independent Kashmir).According to a horse database maintained by the international equestrian federation (FEI), Usman bought a 12-year-old bay-colt named Here-to-Stay from Belinda Isbister of Australia in April 2019, and renamed him Azad Kashmir. Usman is set to ride the same horse at the Olympics as well.With Indias Fouaad Mirza also having qualified for the same event in Tokyo, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has sought legal opinion to check if the matter would fall under the purview of the Olympic Charters Rule 50 which provides a framework to protect the neutrality of sport and the Olympic Games. Rule 50 states that no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.Naming a horse after a region invaded and occupied by Pakistan in 1947, and which India calls Pakistan Occupied Kashmir  the rest of Kashmir is part of the Indian union  may well fall afoul of that rule.Political neutrality has to be maintained at the Olympics at any cost, said IOA president Narinder Batra. People cant be allowed to play mischief at the Games.Meanwhile, an official from the Equestrian Federation of Pakistan (EFP) said that if the International Olympic Committee lodges a formal complaint with the body, then it will take the matter up with Usman Khan. He has chosen the name of the horse and qualified with the same horse, so I dont think the horses name can be changed at this moment, said an official at EFP.Asked what would be his federations stand if the International Olympic Committee intervenes and prohibits Usman from making political statements at the Olympics,the official said the horse would then participate with its FEI identity, a unique alpha-numeric code given to competing horses, instead of its name.If it becomes an issue then well first check if Usman is flexible with changing the name, the EFP official said. But then we can always use its FEI identity instead of the name.',\n",

Ltd, a Nirma group company, for an enterprise value of  5,500 crore, as the founders of the Kolkata-based company seek to pare debt.The transaction is expected to be completed in the next 3-4 months, Emami said in a statement on Thursday.The sale of the cement business is part of Emami groups plan to become debt-free. Last year, the groups founders sold 20% in their flagship household goods company, Emami Ltd, for  2,830 crore as part of the plan.Emami Cement Ltd operates an integrated cement plant in Risdah, Chhattisgarh; and grinding units in Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha, with a total installed capacity of 8.3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). It has mining leases in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.This transaction is an important step in our groups stated objective of becoming debt-free and with this transaction, we will substantially achieve this objective,\" said Manish Goenka, director of Emami Group. We are very proud of Emami Cements achievements in a short span of time and we strongly believe that in Nuvoco, we have found the right acquirer who will be able to develop the business further in the interest of all the stakeholders.\"Law firm Khaitan & Co, led by partners Haigreve Khaitan, Mehul Shah and Ashraya Rao advised Nirma group on the transaction, while Emami was advised by Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.This is Nirmas second cement acquisition in east India. In 2016, Nirma acquired Lafarge Indias cement assets at an enterprise value of $1.4 billion. Lafarge India operated three cement plants and two grinding stations with a total capacity of around 11mtpa.The Emami cement acquisition will bring Nuvocos total cement capacity in eastern, northern and western India to 23.5mtpa, including an ongoing capacity expansion project at its Jojobera plant and over 60 ready-mix plants. The combined operations will span three facilities in Chhattisgarh, two each in Rajasthan and West Bengal and one each in Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Haryana.The Indian cement industry has seen a trend towards consolidation as debt-laden corporates sold their lucrative cement businesses to repay lenders.In 2016, Reliance Infrastructure Ltd sold its cement assets to Birla Corp. Ltd for  4,800 crore as part of the Anil Ambani-led companys efforts to pare debt, while UltraTech Cement Ltd acquired bankrupt cement maker Binani Cement in 2018 for around  7,600 crore.UltraTech had also acquired 21.2mtpa cement capacity from Jaiprakash Associates, part of debt-laden Jaypee Group.While most of the mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the cement sector in recent years have been driven by debt-related issues, other factors are also feeding into the appetite for such deals, said Mumbai-based investment banker Ajay Garg, managing director of Equirus Capital.Changes in various regulations such as mining regulations have also made greenfield development a little challenging and so there is a strong appetite for acquisitions and, hence, we see a lot of buyers when any asset comes up for sale in the market,\" said Garg. With the market leader UltraTech Cement now having a capacity of above 100mtpa, it has created a scale pressure on other cement makers and thus they are more open to M&A to gain scale.\"',\n",

It is also a successful bidder in state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltds tender of 8GW manufacturing-linked development project for setting up solar power capacity.We are delighted to extend our long-term partnership with Total to our renewable energy business,\" Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said in the statement. He was referring to Totals plan, announced in October, to buy a 37.4% stake in Adani Gas for around  5,700 crore.India is running what will become the worlds largest clean energy programme with an aim of having 175GW of clean energy capacity by 2022 as part of its global climate change commitments. The country plans to add 100GW of solar capacity by 2022, including 40GW from rooftop projects.Total is fully engaged in the energy transition and to supporting India, a key country in the fight against climate change, in diversifying its energy mix through partnerships in natural gas and now in solar energy,\" Total chief executive officer CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in the statement.

       " 'Saudi Arabia is using a secretive special court set up for terrorism-related cases to systematically prosecute human rights activists and other dissenting voices who defy the countrys absolute monarchy, a new report has found.The human rights watchdog Amnesty International spent five years investigating 95 cases heard at the Specialised Criminal court (SCC) in Riyadh, concluding in a report published on Thursday that the court is routinely used as a weapon to silence criticism despite the kingdoms recent attempts to cultivate a reformist image.Since 2011, overly broad counter-terror and anti-cybercrime laws have been used by the SCC in unfair trials to hand down prison sentences of up to 30 years and in some cases the death penalty to human rights defenders, writers, economists, journalists, religious clerics, reformists and political activists, particularly from the countrys Shia minority, Amnesty said.Every stage of the SCCs judicial process is tainted with human rights abuses, from the denial of access to a lawyer, to incommunicado detention, to convictions based solely on so-called confessions extracted through torture, said Heba Morayef, Amnestys Middle East and North Africa regional director.Saudi Arabia has embarked on a series of wide-reaching social reforms since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was appointed heir to the throne in 2017, allowing women to drive, curbing the powers of the countrys notorious morality police and granting women the freedom to travel without the permission of a male guardian.The reforms, however, have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, including the detention of high-profile activists such as Loujain al-Hathloul, who campaigned for womens right to drive. Saudi Arabias human rights record has also faced renewed international scrutiny since the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdoms Istanbul consulate in 2018.The SCC was established in 2008 to try individuals accused of crimes related to membership and support of al-Qaida. However, citing court documents, government statements and national legislation, as well as interviews with activists, lawyers and individuals close to the cases documented, Amnesty alleges that the court has morphed into a mockery of justice that targets freedom of speech and peaceful political activity.One of the most disturbing findings shows that the SCC is heavily reliant on confessions extracted under torture conditions. At least 20 people have been sentenced to death, 17 of whom have been executed.Hussein al-Rabi, a defendant in a mass trial of protesters from Saudi Arabias restive Shia-majority Qatif province, was executed in 2019 despite telling the court that his interrogator had hit him and threatened hanging and electric shocks unless he confessed. Rabi refused to do so, so the interrogator denied him food and water, leading to his hospitalisation.The presumption of innocence is not part of the Saudi Arabian judicial system, said Taha al-Hajji, a lawyer who has represented many defendants before the SCC.In response to Amnestys investigation, Saudi Arabias official human rights commission offered a summary of the relevant laws and court procedures but failed to address any of the individual cases raised.',\n",

Confirming the third person in Britain had tested positive, British medical authorities said the unidentified person had contracted the virus outside China.  They acquired it in Asia but not in China, Englands Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said.  Because of that, it is probably now prudent to slightly widen the geographical area where doctors in the UK and NHS know they should test people if they come with the right symptoms. He did not name the country from where the patient had returned.  The government extended a list of countries from which returning travelers who developed symptoms should self-isolate if they showed any of the coronavirus symptoms. It said those returning from Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau as well as China should follow the advice.  These areas have been identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases, the government said.  The third coronavirus patient in Britain has been transferred to a specialist health service center. The first two people in Britain to be diagnosed with the virus are being treated at a hospital in Newcastle, northeast England, Britains health ministry said last week. Coronavirus spread among passengers of a quarantined Japanese cruise liner on Thursday and dragged down production at more global businesses, as scientists across the world searched for a vaccine.

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese city with only eight confirmed cases of a new coronavirus has been accused of intercepting a shipment of surgical masks bound for a municipality with 400 cases, prompting outrage on social media. Hospitals, towns and cities across China are scrambling for supplies of equipment, in particular protective masks, as the number of cases of the coronavirus, which emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December, approaches 30,000.  Nearly 600 people have died. The government of Dali city, in the southwestern province of Yunnan, was accused this week of making an emergency requisition of a shipment of masks bound for the hard-hit     municipality of Chongqing, state media reported. Chongqing told Dali to give them back but the Dali government said on Wednesday it had already distributed the 598 boxes of masks and so could not retrieve them. Dali drew widespread anger on Chinese social media, with many users accusing the city of theft. The Dali government laid the blame on two city officials. One of them, the director of the city health bureau, has been removed from his post, state television reported on Thursday. Other state media also reported that Qingdao in Shandong province gave instructions to its customs to hold on to a shipment of masks and other medical products en route to the northeastern city of Shenyang from South Korea.  Qingdao kept the masks in a tit-for-tat move because it believed Shenyang was holding on to a separate shipment of masks en route to Qingdao, state-controlled China Business News reported on Thursday, citing internal documents.  But both cities have since resolved their dispute, with the two shipments on their way to the respective cities, China Business News said.  Medical resources are very stretched across China as cases of infection and the death toll rise.  Even hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, are facing dwindling supplies. The city, which has more than 10,000 confirmed cases of infection, has called on public support for protective supplies such as masks and suits. The central government said on Saturday that Premier Li Keqiang had asked the European Union to help China get urgent medical supplies.

Miss Shefali, fondly called \\'Queen of Cabaret\\', breathed her last at her Sodepur residence around 6 a.m. on Thursday. She was undergoing treatment for kidney-related ailments.Miss Shefali was synonymous with cabaret dance in Kolkata and was the star attraction of the city\\'s night life in the 1960s and \\'70s. From Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan to Tollywood superstar Uttam Kumar, everyone would be left spellbound by her sensuous performances.Miss Shefali had also appeared in a couple of Bengali movies such as \"Seemabaddha\" and \"Pratidwandi\", both directed by the legendary Satyajit Ray.Last year, Konkona Sen Sharma had announced that she plans to helm a web series based on Miss Shefali\\'s life. The series will chronicle her life, as well as the political environment of West Bengal in the sixties and seventies through her life\\'s journey.Arati Das was the youngest of three sisters hailing from a refugee family of East Bengal (now Bangladesh).

       " 'New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd said on Wednesday that its customers are not yet ready to drive electric cars as the countrys top carmaker appeared unfazed amid a slew of electric vehicle launches by its competitors.Marutis managing director, Kenichi Ayukawa, said in an interview that the high cost of electric vehicles and inadequate charging infrastructure pose major challenges to selling such vehicles in India.He said Marutis customer base mostly comprises people looking to buy affordable small and mid-segment vehicles, and buyers of such products are not so eager to purchase an electric vehicle, which is costlier than a petrol or diesel vehicle.We have to watch the customers and when they want that kind of a product, then we have to offer that kind of an offering. We cannot find that kind of a requirement at this moment. But we have to prepare ourselves,\" Ayukawa said.Maruti on Wednesday showcased its Futuro-e electric vehicle concept at Auto Expo 2020. This was the second consecutive edition of the biennial show where the company has unveiled a concept electric vehicle. Maruti is, however, yet to introduce an electric vehicle.Despite leading the domestic auto market, Suzuki Motor Corp.s most profitable unit has been left behind by the likes of Hyundai Motor Co., Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and new entrant MG Motor India Pvt. Ltd in introducing electric vehicles.Hyundai launched its first long-range electric sport utility vehicle, Kona, in 2019. MG Motor, owned by Chinas SAIC Motor Corp., joined the race in January with the launch of ZS electric vehicle. Both the vehicles are assembled in India from completely knocked- down kits.Maruti has been the undisputed leader in the compact car market and most of its customers are first-time buyers based in metros and tier I cities. Such buyers generally tend to look for fuel-efficient and affordable vehicles.I absolutely say that electric vehicles will come after a few years and we have to prepare for it anytime customers expect. By that, I mean our customers and not anyone else,\" Ayukawa said. Its still not easy to use due to lack of charging space. How are they going to use it? Those kinds of preparations we have to do.\"In 2018, Maruti announced that it has begun testing 50 electric vehicles based on its popular Wagon R hatchback. The company has also commissioned an internal survey to gauge customer expectations for electric vehicles.Unlike the South Koreans and Chinese, Japanese companies such as Suzuki have been lobbying the Indian government for hybrid-electric vehicles, compared to a fully battery-run electric vehicle.Maruti is also betting big on compressed natural gas-based vehicles instead of diesel engine models. Last year, the company announced it would stop selling diesel cars from 1 April 2020 in line with the implementation of stringent Bharat Stage-VI emission norms.Maruti is expected to introduce the petrol version of its Vitara Brezza compact sport utility vehicle and an upgraded version of its Ignis hatchback at the Auto Expo.The New Delhi-based carmaker is also lobbying for a reduction in goods and services tax on hybrid and CNG vehicles from the existing rate of 28% plus cess.The Indian automobile industry has seen a sharp fall in demand in the last one year as a result of the prevailing economic slowdown and transition to new safety and emission norms. The slowdown began in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, which led to a liquidity crunch among non-bank lenders.Local sales of Maruti Suzuki fell 18.6% during April-December 2019 to 1.06 million vehicles from a year earlier. In comparison, the domestic auto industry clocked a 16.4% drop to 2.11 million vehicles.This (fiscal) year we will be down by 15-20% and it is not easy to make a comeback. Next year (vehicle sales) may be a little bit better than this year. After a 15% drop, it is not easy to make a comeback within a year. Maybe, if there is some significant change in trends, then we have a chance,\" Ayukawa said.To improve access to finance options for its customers and dealers, Maruti has been negotiating with banks and has signed agreements with the Federal Bank and Bank of Baroda. This followed banks tightening credit disbursal norms for non-bank lenders and other businesses to clamp down on rising bad loans. This caused a liquidity shortage in the market, which led to a slowdown in vehicle sales.One of the reasons (of the slowdown) is that the financial system is not mature in India. Last year, the banks and the financial companies were not giving loans to the customer and sometime they would ask double the sum for down payment. In that kind of a situation, we cannot encourage the customer to buy the car. So, NBFCs couldnt get supply of money from the banks and they cannot serve the rural areas. It is gradually improving but it will take its time,\" Ayukawa said.',\n",

Describing performance by Pakistans U19 team as immature, Akhtar said that Pakistan Cricket Board needs to invest money and resources at disposal for the improvement of cricket at age group level in the country. Speaking in a video on his Youtube channel, Akhtar said: Indian U19 team was so mature because they have a mature coach. They got Indias best middle-order batsman Rahul Dravid for the coaching role in U19 team. When you get a big guy, you need to pay him big as well. Here, Younis Khan went to take the job, the PCB offered him a job, and then they are bargaining with him. 15 lakh nahi, 13 lakh le lo. He said take it back. Is that how you treat your stars?Akhtar further said that former Pakistan players such as him, Mohammad Yousuf and Younis Khan can be used in coaching roles for the youth teams in the country.

You have to give something to the guy who is leaving everything behind. Yahan kehte hain 10 lakh le lo tum. Who will take the coaching job then? Those who will agree, they will provide such standards.Akhtar further said that PCB needs to take a lesson or two from BCCI, who created a 15-year-plan, and invested money to improve cricket in the country. BCCI has invested in the U19 team. They made a 15-year plan. They brought Jagmohan Dalmiya, N Srinivasan - who brought investment, cricket, and IPL.

They have refused to vacate the key Delhi-Noida link road till the time the CAA was withdrawn by the Narendra Modi government.The protest has triggered massive traffic jams on the other key roads that link the two cities.Adityanath had earlier termed the protest at Shaheen Bagh as a \"malicious attempt to disturb the peace and normal life in Delhi\" where elections will be held on Saturday.Linking the issue with Kashmir, the UP CM had said that the protestors at Shaheen Bagh were those who support terrorists in J&K and shout slogans of azaadi.\"The Shaheen Bagh protest is a pretext. They had to protest against the removal of Article 370 and construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. We can understand their problem.

       " 'Derek Mackay is under intense pressure to quit as a member of the Scottish parliament after being forced to resign as finance secretary for sending hundreds of messages to a 16-year-old boy.Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, revealed on Thursday morning that Mackay had stood down from her government hours before he was due to deliver next years budget. Four hours later, she told MSPs he had also been suspended from the Scottish National party.In an emergency statement, Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament: It was clear to me Derek Mackays conduct fell far short of what was expected of a minister.Derek Mackay was tipped as a possible successor to Nicola Sturgeon, as leader of the Scottish National party, but he has been forced to quit the Scottish government.The 42-year-old stepped down as Scottish finance secretary just hours before he was due to unveil his budget for 2020-21, after reports he had sent hundreds of messages to a 16-year-old boy.It comes more than two decades after he began his career in politics, being elected as a councillor in Renfrewshire in 1999.It made him the youngest male councillor in Scotland, having been elected at just 21.Mackay went on to become leader of the councils SNP group, and took them into power in the area for the first time in 2007- at which point he became leader of the council.He used his role to build a national profile within local politics, becoming the SNP group leader at Cosla - the organisation which represents Scotlands local authorities.In 2011 he was elected to Holyrood as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West.That same year he joined the Scottish government, becoming minister for local government and planning.He was appointed transport minster in a reshuffle after Nicola Sturgeon became first minister in 2014. He was further promoted to the cabinet after the 2016 Scottish election, taking the job of finance and economy secretary.He was previously married and has two children, but in 2013 he came out as gay. He later described that as the most difficult thing Ive ever had to deal with.During his time as finance secretary, he was responsible for introducing new Scottish income tax rates, including a new starter rate set at 19p for lower earners.Opposition leaders said Mackay, 42, should quit immediately as an MSP without waiting for the results of an SNP inquiry. They also questioned why it took Sturgeon 18 hours to announce his suspension.On Thursday, the Scottish Sun published a story about the messages. The papers editor, Alan Muir, told the first ministers office late on Wednesday afternoon it had copies of hundreds of messages that Mackay had sent the schoolboy via Facebook and Instagram.Mackays unsolicited messages, which began on 2 August, included calling him cute a number of times, discussing the boys new haircut, and inviting him to dinner and to a parliamentary event as his guest. He began following the boy, a rugby player, on both platforms last year, liking his photographs.In his statement on Thursday morning, Mackay said he had tendered his resignation to Sturgeon with immediate effect on Wednesday evening. I take full responsibility for my actions. I have behaved foolishly and I am truly sorry. I apologise unreservedly to the individual involved and his family, Mackay said.Because he resigned rather than being sacked, he is now eligible for a Scottish parliament resettlement grant of 11,945 in three months time.His departure forced Sturgeon to ask his deputy, Kate Forbes, 29, to deliver the budget with less than 24 hours notice. Forbes, the public finance minister, first entered parliament in 2016 and is tipped as a future party leader. She became the first woman to deliver a Scottish budget.She told MSPs the Scottish government was freezing the top two rates of Scotlands income tax and raising the threshold of the basic and intermediate bands by inflation, while freezing Scotlands version of property sales stamp duty at its current rate.Mackay, who served for seven years as the SNPs powerful chairman and business convenor, chairing its national conference, had also widely been seen as a contender to replace Sturgeon as leader. He disclosed he was gay after his marriage ended in 2013. He has two sons.Sturgeon told MSPs in her emergency statement that Mackays suspension became necessary only on Thursday morning, once she had read the full text of his messages. However, the editor had given her office details of the most serious messages the previous evening.The Sun reported the boy saying he felt grossed out when Mackay called him cute, and that he stopped responding to his messages on 27 December. Mackay continued messaging him until 1 February, even though the boy refused to reply. The paper said the teenagers mother was furious. I worry about what would have happened if my son had sent him back a message he wanted to hear, she said.The interim Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, suggested Mackay could be guilty of grooming the 16-year-old. Sturgeon said that since Mackay had resigned and been suspended from the SNP, it was for other organisations to decide whether to take further action.Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, said during first ministers questions that Mackay should quit Holyrood. [The messages] are an abuse of power and nothing short of predatory, Leonard said.Speaking to reporters, Sturgeon said she believed Mackay needed to consider his political future, but refused to say he should quit as an MSP. Clearly, there are issues to be reflected on here, but it was inconsistent for the party to suspend him pending further investigation and for me then to immediately pre-empt the outcome of that, she said. But I couldnt be clearer about my views of the seriousness and the severity of the issues we are discussing today.Mary Glasgow, the chief executive of the charity Children 1st, said her organisation has always been clear children and young people are vulnerable in situations where there is a significant difference in age, power and status between them and another person. Society should recognise by now that it is never acceptable to exploit that vulnerability.Police Scotland said it was studying the Suns reports, but stopped short of saying it had begun a criminal investigation. We have not received any complaint of criminality. However, we are assessing available information from media reporting and would encourage anyone with information to please come forward, the force said.The draft budget, which can only be passed with the support of at least one other party as the SNP does not have an overall majority, offers 1.8bn in investments in low-carbon infrastructure, including extra money for low-carbon heating, an extra 270m spending on rail, and 16m on concessionary bus travel.It includes a 3% pay rise for public sector workers earning less than 80,000, and a real-terms increase of 37m in funding for Police Scotland.

The village of Sunndalsora in western Norway, for example, hit 19C (66 Fahrenheit) on January 2, more than 25C above the monthly average, while the Swedish town of Orebro saw its warmest January day on the 9th since records began in 1858.Cross-country ski tracks were closed across large swathes of Norway and Sweden.Exceptional above-average temperatures extended over nearly all of Russia as well, and they were higher than normal over much of the United States, eastern Canada, Japan and parts of eastern China.Temperatures were likewise higher than normal in New South Wales in Australia, where massive bushfires devastated large areas of the state.Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 -- which causes global warming -- are now at their highest level in at least 800,000 years.The United Nations said last year that manmade greenhouse gas emissions needed to tumble 7.6 percent annually over the next decade to cap global warming at 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the aspirational goal set in the landmark Paris Agreement.Current pledges to cut emissions put Earth on a path of several degrees warming by the end of the century.mh/gd',\n",

       " 'HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (HSBA.L) is set to unveil a new round of job cuts targeting senior international managers and reduce its presence in some smaller markets as part of a wider strategy overhaul, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The changes are expected to be part of a strategy update interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn will unveil on Feb. 18 with a view to boosting the profitability of Europes biggest bank by assets in a tough operating environment, the people said. Quinns bid to restructure HSBC comes amid slowing economic growth in its major markets, an outbreak of the fast-spreading  coronavirus, Britains protracted withdrawal from the European Union, and lower interest rates. While it was not clear how many jobs would go, the people said the planned move would mainly hit operations in London and to a lesser extent in Asia, which contributes nearly 90% of the banks profits. The review will look at HSBCs presence in some Latin American markets, the sources said, a region that accounts for just 3% of its pre-tax profit. Apart from Mexico, its presence in other countries in the region such as Argentina is small. HSBC declined to comment. The banks target to cut costs and simplify its notoriously complicated management setup is expected to focus on slashing a large number of global managerial roles across all business units - from investment to commercial banking, the people said. The people spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised by the bank to speak with the media.    HSBC has global managers looking after a wide variety of functions for most of the product lines within its business divisions. Those senior managers are backed by a string of administrative and other support staff. More than cost-cutting, the idea is to make the structure at the top a bit leaner and give more decision-making powers to the regional managers who are closer to the clients, said one of the people who is aware of the internal strategy discussions. After Reuters reported the strategy shift on Wednesday, HSBC said it had appointed Stephen Moss as regional chief executive for Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Canada, bringing regions previously managed separately under his responsibility. HSBC also said Nuno Matos would be appointed chief executive of Europe, replacing James Emmett who will leave the bank in September. Most of the senior bankers in the firing line will be leaving over the next few weeks, the people said. HSBC had 237,685 staff at end of June 2019, an increase of 2,468 over the same period a year ago.  Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said in August the bank would cut about 4,000 jobs in 2019 to reduce costs. It has not yet published figures showing how many jobs went last year. Analysts expect HSBC to report pre-tax profit for 2019 of about $20 billion on Feb.18, in line with the $19.9 billion profit in 2018.  In an internal email this week, HSBC told its staff there would be reports in the media ahead of its strategy and results announcements which it said could be upsetting and that it would not comment on them.  Quinn, who is tipped by HSBC insiders to get the CEO role full-time, talked in October about the need to remodel the bank after dropping its profitability target for 2020 altogether and reporting a sharp fall in earnings. HSBC ousted John Flint as chief executive in August after just 18 months in a shock move the banks chairman said was needed to speed up progress on priority areas such as the turnaround of its U.S. business. While the London-headquartered bank has benefited from   billions of dollars of investment in Asia, mainly in China, over the last few years, a sluggish performance in Europe and the United States has weighed on its returns. In his strategy update, Quinn is likely to unveil plans to boost HSBCs profit outside Asia - including a review of some of its markets producing only low returns - while reiterating HSBCs commitment to invest more in China, the sources said. HSBC is considering pulling out of Turkey and is also seeking to sell or reduce its business in other markets such as Armenia, Greece and Oman where it is struggling to compete with local rivals, Reuters reported last week.

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Teslas (TSLA.O) stock tumbled 17% on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally as a senior executive said the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars and analysts warned of its high valuation. With Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to hold from buy, further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.  Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10. The $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musks plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.  Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Teslas stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies. Even after Wednesdays drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon (AMZN.O) at 49, Apple (AAPL.O) at 22 and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) at 23, according to Refinitiv data. Weve never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record, Gill wrote.  Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day. Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation, Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share. The stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesdays drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.  Teslas rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.  Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG.DE). Even many Tesla bulls question the stocks valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.  Barclays analyst Brian Johnson maintained his underweight rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.  We continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued  but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business, Johnson wrote in a client note. Following Canaccords downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Teslas stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The median price target of analysts is $390. Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Nick Zieminski',\n",

That brings his total stock sales to about $12 billion, with two-thirds of those occurring in the past four years, according to calculations by Bloomberg.The scale of the recent sales  including $2 billion in 2017 and $2.8 billion in 2019  partly reflects Amazons soaring valuation, which closed above $1 trillion for the first time on Tuesday. That means Bezoss remaining 11% stake is worth $116 billion.Their size and frequency though also reflects the changing needs of his increasingly public profile.In the past few years, hes had a style makeover and rarely been out of the headlines since he and MacKenzie Bezos divorced in 2019. That includes hitting the red carpet with girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, hosting a bash at his Washington mansion for the political and financial elite, and even being part of an international controversy after the incendiary claim that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was involved in hacking his phone.Its a far cry from the low profile Bezos cultivated for years.

The outlook for Vodafone Idea remains critical,\" Vodafone Group said in a statement announcing its December quarter earnings on Wednesday.The company is actively seeking various forms of relief from the Indian government to ensure that the rate and level of payments it makes to the Indian government is sustainable and it can meet its other commitments as they fall due,\" the group said.The 24 October court order that ended a 14-year legal battle between telcos and the department of telecommunications (DoT) asked Indias top wireless carriers to cough up more than  1 trillion in dues, straining their already precarious financial situation.Telecom operators had challenged the method adopted by the department of telecommunications to calculate AGR. Licence and spectrum charges are calculated at 8% and 3-5% of AGR, respectively.While the telcos said AGR refers only to revenues from telecom, DoT insisted that it includes all revenues.The Supreme Court upheld the governments definition of adjusted gross revenue and asked operators to pay past dues by 24 January.Airtel owes  35,586 crore to DoT, Vodafone Idea over  50,000 crore, and Tata Teleservices, which has sold its mobile services business to Airtel, owes  14,000 crore.In December, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said that the groups telecom unit, Vodafone Idea, will have to shut shop if there was no relief from the government following the AGR verdict.Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices have sought more time to pay AGR-related dues and last month filed a modification plea in the Supreme Court to negotiate a sustainable payment schedule with the DoT, which has issued demand notices for revenue share, interest and penalty.Bharti Airtels petition said it would need more time to calculate dues across 22 telecom circles over the last 15 years, which is a complex process.Vodafone Idea, meanwhile, said it does not have the resources to pay such huge amounts.As such, if suitable payment terms are not made available, it will lead to the immediate closure of one of the largest and oldest telecom companies in India, causing disruption to 300 million subscribers and putting lakhs of jobs at risk, its petition said.The court is likely to hear the modification pleas next week.',\n",

Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures. Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year.Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development.The U.S. drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage.It is not approved anywhere globally, a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing.Gilead said it had increased manufacturing of remdesivir to create a stockpile that might be used in future viral disease outbreaks. We are doing this before knowing whether the drug is safe and effective to treat 2019-nCoV, the spokesman said.',\n",

Its trying to shore up a core equity capital ratio thats barely above a regulatory minimum of 8%.The lenders shares surged the most since Nov. 27 on Wednesday as investors were encouraged by the move to pick bankers, while its 2023 dollar bond gained the most since Jan. 15. Yes Bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Ravneet Gill, has lost more than 80% of its market value in the past year on concerns about its ability to raise funds.As credibility and sentiment get eroded, time is running out for the bank to raise capital,\" according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Diksha Gera. With the bankers for fund raising in place Yes Bank needs to move quickly to avoid panic among credit investors, which could cause unwanted liquidity pressure.\"Cantor Fitzgerald is led by Anshu Jain, the former co-chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG until 2015, while Gill headed the German banks Indian operations before he joined Yes Bank last year. When Gill took over the reins last year, he told a business daily that Jain was among the people who mentored him in his career.The Economic Times reported the appointment of the banks earlier.A spokesman for Yes Bank and spokeswoman for Ambit declined to comment about the fund raising plans. A representative for IDFC Securities and spokeswoman for Cantor didnt immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Anshu Jain joined Deutsche Bank in June 2012 as co-CEO, along with Juergen Fitschen. He was replaced in June 2015 by John Cryan when Deutsche Bank was fined $2.5 billion for its role in manipulating Libor, more than any other bank. Regulators say the amount would have been lower if Deutsche Bank had cooperated better. The matter undermined Jain because it originated in the investment bank.',\n",

       " 'It has been just a little over a year since she made her Bollywood debut [with Kedarnath; 2018]. Since then, Sara Ali Khan has been on a roll with back-to-back biggies, spearheaded by top filmmakers, with the latest being Imtiaz Alis Love Aaj Kal. And though she is just 24, Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singhs daughter can zap you with her extremely mature and bright take on acting, life and her career. I know who my parents are, and my family is, and I am very proud of that. But in todays day-and-age, anybody who tries to remind me of that will only try to pressurise me. And I would not like to fall for that so I dont think about it much. I am proud of being their daughter or granddaughter [her grandmother is Sharmila Tagore] but I have always  aspired to and will continue to aspire to make my own identity, and thats what I am focusing on, says Sara. Excerpts from an interview:Theres a little bit of nervousness. But I think thats only because I was probably given a little more love than I deserved very early on in my career. Now, I think, Im aware of the fact that I need to live up to that [love]. But its not pressurising since I dont take pressure. I feel Ive reached a stage wherein I want to make myself more and more proud. After Kedarnath, I was given a certain amount of love as well as acceptance, and now, I just want to be able to reiterate to myself and the audiences that I am truly worthy of all of that.I think the media likes me so they made me feel welcome very early on in life, and I appreciate that a lot. Thats why I want to keep up the good work. At the same time, our job is also such that were constantly learning. Every film, journey, director and character is different. Love Aaj Kal has been a special journey because its Imtiaz sirs take on todays love. But Sara and Zoe are not the same. It is sirs take on a girl like Zoe which is not me. So, the only way Ive understood Zoe has been through Imtiaz sir, and Im very thankful for that. Its been a great experience for me and I hope people like what they see.I think the media had decided to like me even before Kedarnath released (laughs). Ive only got love and acceptance from them. I dont think I have to make them love me as they have already been very gracious with me. Now, I just hope that I keep making them more and more proud. I look at them like family because they make me who I am. Its their words, captions, articles and vision that gives me the confidence that I have today. So, now, its my turn to make them feel that I deserve their love.Whatever talks have happened, or will happen are going to continue, so I dont really listen and pay heed to any kind of talks. But I dont think Sara and Kartik were interacting on set because Imtiaz sirs romance and his world is so overwhelming that it was only Zoe and Veer on set, who got to know each other very well. Every day that we were on set, we discovered ourselves and our characters more even as the chemistry between Zoe and Veer kept growing. It is Imtiaz sirs vision and we were clear about the execution. Also, sir was clear about what he wanted from the two different characters. For me, it was very interesting to see how that chemistry brewed.I dont think anybody is a baby here, and no one even treats you that way. And thats fine. You enter [the industry] with full knowledge and awareness that this is a cut-throat world. You know that everybody is very hungry and extremely driven here. No one gets brownie points for being educated, being a star child, being sweet, wearing white salwar-kameez or greeting people with a namaste. It really doesnt matter. What  you do on screen is what ultimately counts.I am very excited because for me, the reason to do what I do is because they [the roles] are all so different. On one hand, I am playing a feisty Delhi girl in a romantic film with Imtiaz Ali, and then, I portray a high-energy, excited Goan girl in Coolie No 1. And then, I play a very real and rooted character in Atrangi Re. Since they are such different characters with such distinct filmmakers, each set is going to be different.

       " \"From imitating Shah Rukh Khans iconic vibrato hum to impersonating a muffler-draped politician in various web clips, actor Jitendra Kumar aka Jeetu Bhaiyya of  Kota Factory fame has been in the limelight for some time now. And his blink-and-miss kissing scene with Ayushmann Khurrana in the trailer of the upcoming film Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan has taken this up a notch.  Read: Ayushmann Khurrana says true patriotism doesnt mean blind love, but improving your countryWhile onscreen intimacy between actors of the opposite sex took a long time to gain normalcy in Bollywood, it is but obvious for actors to be nervous and sceptical about doing same-sex kissing scenes. However, this was not the case with Jitendra. As soon as I heard that the film was about a gay love story, it was obvious [to me] that there would be romance. The concept of two guys falling in love and their feelings towards each other was important to be portrayed. So, I was not very hesitant regarding the script and the kissing scene. But the anticipation of the scene and the question of my comfort doing it, for sure, were on my mind. However, Ayushmann and the entire crew created a very comfortable space for me, shares the actor, who says that this was his second onscreen kiss and the very first with a male actor. Ask him how the kiss turned out to be and Jitendra is quick to answer, It was not very different from kissing a girl.  Daadhi thodi chubhti hai (laughs), but yeah, it is the same. The film, which is about a homosexual couple who fight all odds for their love, will raise important questions on the topic of same-sex relationships. It also promises a lot of laughter, which, in turn, highlights the trend in Bollywood of using humour to talk about serious issues. For instance, while the critically acclaimed film  Fire (1996), which also talked about homosexuality, couldnt connect to the audience, films like the John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan-starrer Dostana (2008) and now Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan are lauded by the audience. I am a very big fan of Fire... But I feel that Fire, and any movie in that tone, will only resonate with people who are already cool about homosexuality... When bringing such a topic to the regular audience, one needs to make it a family entertainer, and comedy helps with that We want everyone to enjoy the film, while getting across the message that such love is normal, he explains. Let's take PRIDE in being unprejudiced citizens of India! Wish you a zyada happy #RepublicDay #ShubhMangalZyadaSaavdhan   @smzsofficialA post shared by  Jitendra Zyada Kumar (@jitendrak1) on Jan 25, 2020 at 7:56pm PSTThe actor was earlier seen in the Shweta Tripathi-starrer Gone Kesh (2019), a film about a medical condition alopecia, and his next also deals with a social subject. While actors would be afraid about getting typecast doing similar roles, Jitendra has a lukewarm attitude about it. He says, I havent done much work in Bollywood. I wont get typecast so soon. I feel one should see how unique the script is and whether it speaks to the audience or not... But I hope I get different types of films and I get to play different roles... As far as his future plans are concerned, the actor is very clear. I am looking for promising scripts, both in Bollywood and on the web. All I hope for is good roles and good people to work with, he concludes. Author tweets @scriblaniac Follow @htshowbiz for more\",\n",
       " 'At least 200 Salvadoran migrants and asylum seekers have been killed, raped or tortured after being deported back to El Salvador by the United States government which is turning a blind eye to widely known dangers, a new investigation reveals.Human Rights Watch has documented 138 deported Salvadorans murdered by gang members, police, soldiers, death squads and ex-partners between 2013 and 2019. The majority were killed within two years of deportation by the same perpetrators they had tried to escape by seeking safety in the US.The report, Deported to Danger: United States deportation policies expose Salvadorans to death and abuse, also identifies more than 70 others who were subjected to beatings, sexual assault and extortion  usually at the hand of gangs  or who went missing after being returned.El Salvador, the most densely populated country in Central America with just over 6 million citizens, has one of the worlds highest rates of homicide and sexual violence. In addition, almost 11,000 people were registered missing during the last decade - more than the number of people who disappeared during the 1979-1992 civil war.Authorities are largely ineffective in protecting the population from this violence, which is often perpetrated by street gangs which have 60,000 or so members across the country.Extrajudicial executions, sexual assaults, enforced disappearances and torture have also been perpetrated by state security forces with almost total impunity.Amid widespread terror and impunity, the number of Salvadorans fleeing has soared, with asylum applicants in the US increasing by almost 1,000% in five years to 60,000 in 2017, according to UN figures.The dire security situation is well documented, but despite this, the US continues to deport Salvadorans to face abuse and even death, according to HRW.For instance, 17-year-old Javier escaped gang recruitment in 2010 and sought asylum in the US where his mother Jennifer had already fled. His asylum application was rejected, and Javier was deported in early 2017, aged 23. Four months later he was killed by members of the Mara Salvatrucha-13 gang.The United States has to have known this was happening because the cases were publicly reported and more importantly because Salvadorans make it clear in asylum applications that this is their reality. But this reality is ignored or not believed by US authorities, said Elizabeth Kennedy, co-author of the report.International law prohibits the US from returning anyone to a country where they face serious risks to their lives or safety.About three-quarters of the 1.2 million Salvadorans living in the US without citizenship lack papers or hold a temporary legal status making them vulnerable to deportation. Between 2014 and 2018, the US deported 111,000 Salvadorans, and granted asylum to just 18.2% of applicants  the lowest rate in the region.Deportations  and violence against deportees  is not a new phenomenon. But the approval of asylum claims plummeted since the Trump administration rolled out a series of hostile policies including Remain in Mexico  officially known as Migration Protection Protocols  and imposed tight restrictions on gender-based and gang-related grounds for asylum.The attack on asylum is unique in the Trump administration, which has put even more Salvadorans  and others  at risk of deportation, and made it much less likely that they are able to even present their case to get effective protection, said Kennedy.HRW researchers tracked and verified hundreds of press reports, and conducted 150 interviews with deportees, surviving family members, government and security officials, and US immigration attorneys.The actual number of killings and attacks is probably significantly higher than reported as most crimes in El Salvador go unreported, state violence are covered up, and its too dangerous for journalists to enter some neighbourhoods.Alison Parker, managing director of HRWs US programme and co-author of the report, said: Salvadorans are facing murder, rape and other violence after deportation in shockingly high numbers, while the US government narrows Salvadorans access to asylum and turns a blind eye to the deadly results of its callous policies.',\n",

Turkeys Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD) said 33 people were killed when the second avalanche hit while they were searching for two more victims of the first snowslip, which killed five people, after rescuing eight others. Speaking to reporters in Van, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said 75 people were injured, adding that around 700 additional emergency rescue personnel were dispatched to the area. TV footage from Bahcesaray district in the eastern province of Van showed dozens of people using shovels and sticks in snowfall and high winds to dig out vehicles that had been buried and toppled in the avalanche, which occurred on Tuesday evening. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said conditions in the area made it difficult for rescue vehicles to operate, adding that a vehicle had been pulled out from under 4-5 meters (16 feet) of snow. He later said that rescue operations had been put on hold as authorities feared a third avalanche in the area. He said rescue efforts would resume after inspections on Thursday morning. Osman Ucar, head of AFADs Van office, was hospitalized after being caught in the avalanche. He told Ihlas News Agency from hospital that some 200 people were working in the rescue operation but many were out of the immediate area when the second avalanche hit on Wednesday. I was halfway buried in snow, he said. I got out by my own means.

       " 'Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar Games, is leaving his post in March, according to the developers parent company Take-Two Interactive. Houser was lead writer on the multimillion-selling Grand Theft Auto series, as well as other Rockstar hits including the acclaimed western adventure Red Dead Redemption.In a statement to investors on Tuesday, Take-Two stated that Houser, who was creative vice president at the studio, would leave Rockstar on 11 March after taking an extended break, which began in spring last year. Housers brother Sam, with whom he co-founded Rockstar Games in 1998, will stay on as company president.Houser started writing on the groundbreaking Grand Theft Auto series while working for BMG Interactive, which published the first two GTA titles. When BMG was acquired by Take-Two, the Houser brothers formed Rockstar Games to continue the series, overseeing the landmark Grand Theft Auto 3, which drastically improved the games visuals and scope. For the next 20 years, Dan Houser was lead creative on the series, working closely with a small narrative team, and also writing for Max Payne and Red Dead Redemption.In 2018, Houser said that finishing Red Dead Redemption 2 had required exhausting 100-hour working weeks. The revelation caused controversy in the games industry where crunch culture  the expectation that staff will work long hours for many months of game development in order to meet deadlines  has become a hot topic. Rockstar later clarified the comments by saying these hours were undertaken by the core writing team and not the whole studio. Dan Housers exit from the Grand Theft Auto team follows the 2016 departure of former lead designer Les Benzies, previously president of the Rockstar North studio in Edinburgh, and comes at a time when rumours of a possible sixth title have been growing. The series is the most financially successful in video games history, generating an estimated $6bn (4.6bn) since its inception.Working alongside Rupert Humphries (son of comedian Barry Humphries), Dan Houser has overseen the narrative design of the Grand Theft Auto titles, drawing influences from cult movies and the street culture of New York and Los Angeles, as well as satirising modern urban life. For us, it starts with the characters, he told the Guardian in 2012. The story is always driven by the characters  its always got to feel like someone you want to be propelled through the game world with. Then well find a cool, interesting and amusing cast to juxtapose them with, and make sure weve got a good range of types. If the process feels organic to us then were heading in the right direction.No reason has been given for Housers departure.

       " 'HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finlands woman-led centre-left government plans to give new fathers the same amount of paid time off work as new mothers, nearly doubling paternity leave, it announced on Wednesday. Paid paternity leave will be extended to nearly seven months, in line with maternity leave. Around half can be given to the other parent. Pregnant women are also entitled to a month of pregnancy leave before the expected date of birth. Minister of Health and Social Affairs Aino-Kaisa Pekonen said the aim of the radical reform was both to improve gender equality and to boost a declining birth rate.     This enables better equality between parents and diversity among families, she said. The number of newborns in Finland fell by around a fifth between 2010 and 2018, to just 47,577 babies in a country of around 5.5 million people. Pekonen said other countries such as Sweden and Iceland had seen increases in their birth rates after offering more leave for fathers. Finlands coalition of five parties, all led by women of whom four are under 35 years old, took office in December and has made gender equality a priority.  Speaking at the 50th annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos last month, Prime Minister Sanna Marin called for states  and companies to do more to ensure women were treated fairly, saying gender equality doesnt happen by itself. A previous centre-right Finnish government attempted to reform parental leave in 2018 but eventually rejected the idea as too costly. Pekonen said a more equal distribution of domestic workload between parents has been proven to diminish the risk of divorce. Over a longer term, it also improves equality in working life and in wages by directing fathers to use a larger proportion of parental leaves than before, she said.

       " 'Abu Dhabis long-troubled Etihad Airways said Tuesday it would sell 38 aircraft to an investment firm and a leasing company in a deal valued at USD 1 billion, the latest cost-cutting measure by the United Arab Emirates national carrier. Etihad said it would sell 38 aircraft  22 Airbus A330s and 16 Boeing 777-300ERs  in the deal with investment firm KKR and leasing firm Altavair AirFinance. KKR said the Boeing 777-300ERs will be leased back to Etihad upon purchase in early 2020, while the Airbus A330s will go to international clients. Etihad described the move as being in line with the third year of its transformation program.   The deal offers us flexibility while ensuring we stand by our sustainability targets and maintain a fleet of the most fuel-efficient, technologically advanced aircraft, the airline said in a statement.Etihads website lists itself as having a fleet of 102 aircraft. It no longer lists its A330s among its fleet, having said it would begin phasing those aircraft out. The 16 Boeing 777s it will sell and lease back represent 15 per cent of its current fleet.Since 2016, Etihad has lost a total of USD 4.75 billion as its strategy of aggressively buying stakes in airlines from Europe to Australia to compete against Emirates and fellow rival Qatar Airways exposed the company to major losses.Etihad lost USD 1.28 billion in 2018. It has yet to release results for 2019.In the time since 2016, it has embarked on a cost-cutting initiative and recently announced it would restructure planned aircraft purchases from Airbus and Boeing.The airline reported revenues of $5.86 billion in 2018, down from USD 6 billion in 2017.It flew 17.8 million passengers last year, down from 18.6 million the year prior.Previously, Etihad reported losses of USD 1.52 billion for 2017 and USD 1.95 billion in 2016. It blamed challenging market conditions and effects of an increase in fuel prices in part for the loss in 2018.Abu Dhabis rulers launched Etihad in 2003, competing with the established Dubai government-owned carrier Emirates that flies out of Dubai International Airport only 115 kilometers (70 miles) away. In 2018, Etihad began loaning pilots to Emirates under a new program. Both Emirates and Etihad have seen business hurt by President Donald Trumps travel bans affecting Muslim-majority nations. Thats even with Abu Dhabi International Airport having a US Customs and Border Protection preclearance facility, allowing passengers arriving in America to immediately leave. Its the only such facility in the Mideast. The two airlines are government-owned carriers in the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Both compete in the long-haul carrier market, using their nations location between East and West to their advantage. Both airlines continued to fly to China amid the ongoing outbreak of the new coronavirus, even as other Western and Arab airlines stopped.

People who spread the virus intentionally and endanger public security could be regarded as violating the Criminal Law, which states that actions that endanger public security; can be subject to the death penalty if the situation is severe, the state-controlled tabloid, Global Times reported.The MPS will come down heavily on those spreading rumours, the tabloid said.Those who use the virus to fabricate or spread rumors, to promote secession from China or undermine national unity, or incite subversion of state power or the overthrow of the socialist system can face a maximum 15-year jail term, the report added.Chinese state councilor and MPS minister has directed public security organs at all levels to probe illegal and criminal activities that cause trouble and sabotage social order, and resolutely safeguard national political security.Manufacturing and selling counterfeit and substandard medicines and medical devices, harming medical personnel, disrupting medical services, blocking or interrupting traffic, and using the epidemic to inflate prices will be severely punished, the ministry said.The tabloid reported that on January 23, Beijing authorities imposed a maximum 3 million yuan ($429,000) of fine on a local pharmacy that raised the price of N95 masks from 200 to 850 yuan per box.',\n",

The 17,000 ton Hakuo was docked at the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, which is also the home port of the U.S. Navys Ronald Reagan carrier. If put into service, the ship will initially take up to 94 people, but can accommodate more. Around 300 people could comfortably live on the ship and it has a maximum capacity for 500, although that would mean queues for the baths and other facilities, a Japan Self Defense Force official told Reuters. Preparations aboard the Hakuo come as health authorities placed more than 3,500 people on two weeks quarantine on a cruise liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed that 10 people on the ship had tested positive for coronavirus and more cases were possible. Japans government has come in for criticism that it has been too slow to respond to the health crisis. Unlike other countries, Japan has not yet forcibly quarantined people who may carry the coronavirus, including Japanese returning on evacuation flights from Wuhan in central China where the epidemic began.  Japan has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases so far, including 17 people who had been in Wuhan and the 10 on the cruise liner.  Since Saturday, Japan has refused entry to foreigners who have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and may widen the ban to other parts of China. People quarantined aboard the Hakuo will be confined to quarters for around 10 days and provided with a tablet computer and Wifi to help them pass the time, the Japanese defense official said. Each will be provided with toiletries and other necessities during their stay, with meals brought to their rooms, he added. reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan',\n",

Going forward, we will be collaborating with public sector and foreign banks for co-lending opportunities. Co-lending opportunities help in generating fee income and main ROEs despite our diversification into retail financing,\" Piramal said.Piramal also said there are many portfolio purchasing and merger and acquisition (M&A) prospects in the housing finance sector, as it has slowed down due to liquidity crunch, which has led to some of these companies vacating the space.The group had earlier said its strategy is to build newer platforms for co-lending with like-minded institutions.Piramal had partnered with pension and sovereign funds for co-funding. In May 2019, it had signed an agreement with Canadas largest pension fund manager Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to co-sponsor Indias first renewable energy-focused infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) with an initial targeted corpus of up to $600 million.On the real estate front, Piramal in December had collaborated with IIFL Wealth Management Ltd. Under this collaboration, both will co-invest in an alternative investment fund (AIF) with a target corpus of  2000 crore and will back projects that are at an advanced stage of completion.Piramal, along with Bain Capital Credit, has formed an India Resurgence Fund (IRF) to invest capital directly into distressed businesses. Four investments have been made from this fund.By March 2020, the company would exceed its earlier stated commitment of bringing in  8,00010,000 crore of equity, with inflows of up to  14,500 crore, through various initiatives....With this capital infusion, our company is well-capitalised to tap both organic and inorganic opportunities arising from industry consolidation and effectively transform our financial services business from a largely wholesale business into a well-diversified financial services business,\" the chairman told analysts.As far as the pharmaceutical business is concerned, the group plans to raise additional equity capital for growth in the future.\"...Infusion of additional capital in pharma is the next step towards unlocking the value of the company,\" Piramal said.',\n",

       " 'An archaic tax law on the island of Jersey in effect deeming that a wifes income belongs to her husband is being scrapped.Politicians on the Channel island have backed a proposal that married women should have the same income tax rights  and responsibilities  as their husbands.It means that wives will always be able to talk to Revenue Jersey on tax matters without the permission of a husband.The change will also mean that younger partners in same sex marriages and civil partnerships will have equal rights. At the moment, for tax purposes, the younger person is essentially considered the wife and the older the husband.Susie Pinel, the a Treasury minister on Jersey, said: This will give equal rights to both spouses and civil partners under Jerseys tax law. It will remove the archaic presumption in the current law that a wifes income is deemed to belong to her husband.It brings to an end an outdated system that treats married women and younger spouses in same-sex relationships unfairly.During a debate on the issue at the States Assembly on Tuesday, Pinel said the anomaly dated back to 1928 when income tax was introduced on Jersey.The minister added that when civil partnerships and same-sex marriages were introduced there was no time to reform the tax laws.Instead the law assumed that the older partner would take the place of the husband and the younger the wife. Pinel said this could be seen as discriminatory and offensive and possibly open to legal challenge.She said the change will convert so-called married mans taxation into couples taxation  and was a stepping stone towards the introduction of independent taxation.There have been concerns from bodies including Citizens Advice Jersey that the move could lead to a bigger tax bill for some couples. The Jersey Chamber of Commerce expressed concern that it would make the spouse/civil partner liable for the debt of the other party.Pinel said: To be clear, my proposition has no negative financial impact on any couple. It simply brings to an end an outdated system that treats married women and younger spouses in same-sex relationships unfairly.A very small number of commentators have raised concerns over [making] a couple jointly liable for the payment of any outstanding taxes that they may owe. But with equal rights come equal responsibilities and we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place in the event of financial hardship.Sam Mzec, a Jersey senator, said the change was well overdue. He added: Its simply wrong that in the year 2020 our tax law erases the identity of married women. Its the stuff of medieval times, not the modern age. This ends that injustice. It puts us where we ought to have been for decades.Not all members were enthusiastic supporters. Senator Kristina Moore said she backed greater equality but claimed this stepping stone measure muddied the waters.Concern was also expressed during the debate that a person could suddenly desert a family, leaving their partner facing a tax bill. The prospect of a coercive man or woman manipulating a partner by threatening them with the prospect of being liable for tax debts was also raised.But the proposal won the backing of 40 members, with two against and two abstentions.Jersey is not part of the UK but is a self-governing dependency with its own directly elected legislative assemblies, administrative, fiscal and legal systems and its own courts of law.

Videos of the stunt shot by bystanders are being widely circulated on social media platforms. Police have also taken note of the video and are on the lookout for the offender.Reports by sections of the media suggest that the man who took the plunge was a foreign national visiting India as a tourist. The identity of the man, however, is still unknown. An official statement in this regard from Varanasi police is also awaited. Once traced, the man is likely to be booked for endangering his own life and that of others living in the area.It is worth noting that the power transmission tower used by the man to perform the stunt transmits 1 lakh 33 thousand KVA electricity. The stunt could have also cost the tourist his life if his parachute was entangled in the overhead wires. While some inputs suggest that the daredevil in question is an Italian tourist, the same is yet to be confirmed by means of an official statement by the Varanasi police.A similar incident was reported from the American state of Wisconsin in October of last year.

Trump avoided the subject of his impeachment drama in a pugnacious 80-minute speech, but the raw wounds from the battle were evident with fellow Republicans giving him standing ovations while rival Democrats for the most part remained seated. The Republican-led Senate was expected to acquit him of charges he abused his powers and obstructed Congress during a vote beginning at 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT) on Wednesday.     Seeing Pelosi, the U.S. House of Representatives speaker, for the first time since she stormed out of a White House meeting four months ago, Trump declined to shake her outstretched hand as he gave her a paper copy of his remarks before starting to speak.  Despite having not spoken to Trump since their last meeting, Pelosi appeared to be taken aback. She avoided citing the customary high privilege and distinct honor that usually accompanies the speakers introduction of the president to Congress. Members of Congress, the President of the United States was all she said in introducing Trump. When his speech ended, Pelosi stood and tore up her copy of the remarks he had handed her, later telling reporters it was the courteous thing to do, considering the alternative. Kayleigh McEnany, Trumps campaign spokeswoman, said of Pelosi: Her hatred for @realdonaldtrump has blinded her to the repulsive nature of her smug, elitist behavior. After the event, Pelosi tweeted a photo of her with her hand reaching out to Trump and said, Democrats will never stop extending the hand of friendship to get the job done #ForThePeople. We will work to find common ground where we can, but will stand our ground where we cannot. #SOTU The tension was a sign that little legislative progress should be expected with the presidential election nine months away. The impeachment case has intensified bitter feelings between Trump, a former reality TV star-turned conservative politician, and Pelosi, a California liberal, that have existed throughout his presidency. He routinely calls her Crazy Nancy at his campaign rallies. As he began the speech, Republicans from both houses of Congress chanted four more years while he stood at the lectern in the chamber of the House. Democrats sat silently and some could be seen shaking their heads as Trump declared, The state of our union is stronger than ever before. Pelosi, who dropped her opposition to impeachment and allowed Democratic lawmakers to seek the charges against him, sat stoically and grim-faced behind Trump and paged through a paper copy of his speech as he spoke. Trump entered the chamber with Democrats experiencing unease and chaos after technical glitches delayed the results of voting in Iowa on Monday, the first 2020 contest as the party seeks a nominee to face the incumbent Republican. Trump presented himself as a big improvement over Democratic President Barack Obama, whom he succeeded three years ago, saying he had bolstered U.S. economic growth and increased jobs. In just three short years we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of Americas destiny, he said. The House impeachment managers, acting as prosecutors in the Senate impeachment trial, were seated together at the front of the Democrats section. Many House Democratic women wore white for a second year in a row, a sign of the suffrage movement that won women the right to vote 100 years ago. Several Democratic lawmakers refused to attend the annual speech to protest Trump, such as liberal firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Trump, using the speech to lay out his vision for a second four-year term, said a Democratic plan to expand government-funded health insurance amounted to a socialist takeover that would bankrupt the country, cut benefits for those who have them now and provide care to illegal immigrants. Democratic presidential candidates and many lawmakers have proposed healthcare plans that would be run by the government, a sharp departure from the current, private system in which millions of Americans receive medical insurance from their employers. Trumps lack of a healthcare plan has left him open to criticism that he has not put enough work into finding a way to reduce rising insurance costs that burden middle-class Americans. We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare! Trump said. Democratic women stood and chanted HR 3 - a reference to a Democratic bill that would lower drug costs. In the televised Democratic response to Trumps speech, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said: Democrats are trying to make your healthcare better. Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away. Trump offered an upbeat portrayal of his presidency in hopes of persuading Americans to give him another four-year term in the Nov. 3 election.He saluted surprise guest Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader, and made cancer-stricken conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh an immediate recipient of the presidential Medal of Freedom, with Trumps wife Melania pinning the ribbon around Limbaughs neck. Trump also revived his polarizing arguments that migrants should be stopped from crossing the southern U.S. border and that so-called sanctuary cities where migrants are protected are wrong. His immigration policies are opposed by Democrats. Pelosi could be seen shaking her head as Trump spoke of his views on immigration. After coming close to a broad conflict with Iran after he ordered the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, Trump said, We are working to end Americas wars in the Middle East.

       " 'South Africa batsman Temba Bavuma, who played a match-winning knock against England in the first ODI, has accepted that constantly being viewed through the prism of his skin colour has affected him. On Tuesday, Bavuma (98) shared a 173-run second-wicket stand with skipper Quinton de Kock (107) as they chased down Englands 259 with 14 balls to spare. Unfortunately, Bavuma just fell two runs short of a second ODI century as Chris Jordan skidded a ball through to trap him on his crease.It has been hard, Bavuma, who was speaking for the first time since his recall to the national team last month, was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.ALSOREAD: Australia recall Glenn Maxwell for South Africa, Marcus Stoinis snubbedIts not so much the dropping part, all players get dropped, everyone goes through slumps of not scoring well. The awkwardness and uncomfortability from my side is when you are thrown into talks of transformation.Yes, I am black, thats my skin. But I play cricket because I love it. Id like to think the reason I am in the team is because of performances I have put forward in my franchise side, and also for the national team, whenever I have been able to. The discomfort was there, having to navigate myself around all those types of talks. Players get dropped, I am not the last guy to get dropped. Thats something weve come to accept, he added. According to South Africa rules, the national team has to always field six players of their colour, including two black Africans. Bavuma has found himself caught in a race storm on social media with some arguing that he was only part of South Africas plans because of the existence of the transformation target. However, the 29-year-old rejected the argument and called for a fair judgment of the ideology of transformation.The one thing that irks me is when you are seen through the eyes of transformation, he said. When you do well, transformation is not spoken about but when you do badly, transformation is thrown at the top of the agenda. I have a serious problem with that. Weve got to be able to take the good with the bad. If transformation is bad when black African players are not doing well, then when we are doing well, lets also recognise transformation for what its done.South Africa will now face England in the second ODI on Friday at Kingsmead, Durban.',\n",

       " 'LILONGWE (Reuters) - Malawis Constitutional Court on Monday annulled the May 2019 presidential vote that declared Peter Mutharika a winner and ordered a re-run after an application from opposition parties citing irregularities. Mutharika, Malawi president since 2014, won the election with a 38.57% share of the vote, with opposition party leader Lazarus Chakwera getting 35.41% and Deputy President Saulos Chilima, who formed his own party, had 20.24% in the final tally. The electoral commission declared Mutharika the winner despite complaints of irregularities including results sheets with sections blotted out or altered with correction fluid. Mutharika had pledged to crack down on corruption and revive the economy in his second five-year term. But Chakwera, the presidents main rival, and Chilima rejected the results and filed a petition to the High Court asking it to nullify the results. In a unanimous decision, a panel of five judges ordered that a new presidential vote be held within 150 days. It is almost impossible to have an election free of irregularities, said Justice Healey Potani, who headed the panel. However, in the present matter our finding is that the anomalies and irregularities have been so widespread, systematic and grave such that the integrity of the result was seriously compromised, and cant be trusted as the will of voters of the May 21, 2019 election.  In a landmark ruling for the country, the court describe the conduct of the electoral commission as very lacking and demonstrated incompetence. The status in the presidency would revert to before the elections, Potani said, which meant Chilima would be reinstated as vice president. The court also directed Parliament to consider recalling the current electoral body, which is headed by Supreme Court of Appeal Judge Jane Ansah, to ensure smooth conduct of fresh elections. The streets in Lilongwe and the commercial capital Blantyre were unusually quiet ahead of the ruling, and many businesses were shut, fearing violence and looting from supporters of the losing side. Security forces were out on the streets in large numbers, and the judges delivering the verdict were flown in on a military plane and arrived at the venue in armoured vehicles. Malawi, a lakeside nation on the southern tip of the Great Rift Valley, is dependent on foreign aid and is frequently beset by drought which threatens the lives of thousands of people. Former law professor Mutharika, 79, oversaw infrastructure improvements and a slowdown in inflation in his first five-year term, but critics accuse him of cronyism and failing to tackle graft.

       " 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Around 3,700 people are facing at least two weeks locked away on a cruise liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed on Wednesday that 10 people on the ship had tested positive for coronavirus and more cases were possible. While the infected patients were transferred by Japans coastguard to hospitals on the mainland, the rest of the passengers and crew on board the Carnival Corp (CCL.N) ship were placed in quarantine and given health screenings. The 10 cases were among 31 results received so far from 273 people tested. Passengers on Carnivals Diamond Princess, which had arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip, will now spend another two weeks on the ship off Yokohama port near Tokyo. They took to social media to detail their predicament, posting photos of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks, room service meals and empty corridors and decks.  British passenger David Abel said passengers were confined to their cabins on Wednesday morning, with staff delivering food room-by-room. The challenging situation for me is that Im an insulin dependent diabetic, Abel said in a video taken in his cabin and posted to his Facebook page, adding that regular and timed food intake was a key part of managing his condition. We dont have a choice in what we can eat, the announcement recently was that theyre starting on the bottom deck and working their way up - Im on the ninth deck. A 43-year-old Hong Kong resident on the ship with six family members said they had been given coffee and water, but no food, by lunchtime on Wednesday. They were hungry but had snacks of their own, he said. I am not looking forward to the range of emotions in the next two weeks, he told Reuters from his familys windowless room, declining to be named. Will deal as they come. Another passenger, using the handle @daxa_tw, tweeted that he was hearing from many sides that people are troubled and uneasy. Separately, public broadcaster NHK said an additional two people had tested positive in Japan. One was a man in his 40s who was visiting Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, from Chinas Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.  The other was a man in his 20s who lives in Kyoto. He had not been to China but had contacts with Chinese tourists as he worked in hospitality industry, NHK said. That brought the total number of people infected in Japan to 35.  Carnivals Princess Cruises said quarantined passengers would get free internet and telephone services and the crew was working to keep them comfortable. The ship was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong on Jan. 25. The man had joined a shore excursion in Kagoshima, southwestern Japan, on Jan. 22, local media reported. He was believed to have been in close contact with 36 passengers, Kyodo news reported, citing Japans health ministry. Two of those people are among the 10 who have already tested positive, Kyodo said. Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said officials would continue to monitor the remaining passengers and crew for the potential development of symptoms. None of the 10 infected people - three each from Japan and Hong Kong, two Australians, one American and one Filipino crew member - had severe symptoms, NHK reported.  Carnival said quarantined passengers would get a full refund and a future cruise credit. The ship would go out to sea to perform normal marine operations, it added, including the production of fresh water, before receiving food and other supplies from Yokohama. Not all passengers were overly concerned about their situation. American Ashley Rhodes-Courter posted a text message exchange on Instagram with her parents, Gay and Phil Courter, who are on board the ship. The food is great, the staff is in good spirits and were all in the same boat, the couple said. Plus, they have not run out of some great Pinot noir.

       " 'Lesothos first lady Maesiah Thabane has been charged with murder for her alleged links to the brutal 2017 killing of the prime ministers previous wife.Maesiah Thabane, 42, will spend the night in custody after she came out of hiding and turned herself in to the police earlier on Tuesday.She has been charged with murder alongside eight others who are in Lesotho and South Africa, deputy police commissioner Mokete Paseka told reporters, adding that investigations had been satisfactorily completed.He said police had a strong case against the first lady, who was unable to appear in court on Tuesday due to logistical reasons.The eight other accused will also be summoned by the police.Maesiah Thabane went missing last month after being summoned as part of an investigation into the killing of Lipolelo Thabane  prime minister Thomas Thabanes estranged wife. Lipolelo and Thomas Thabane were involved in bitter divorce proceedings when she was gunned down outside her home in Lesothos capital Maseru in June 2017, two days before her husbands inauguration.New evidence surfaced in early January, when a letter from Lesothos police chief was made public alleging that communication records from the day of the crime picked up the prime ministers mobile number.Thomas Thabane, who is now 80, has since bowed to pressure and offered to resign at a date not yet disclosed. He has also been questioned by the police over the killing.But his current wife Maesiah vanished when the police called her in to testify last month, prompting the issuing of an arrest warrant.The prime ministers press attach did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the murder charge.The murder of 58-year-old Lipolelo Thabane sent shock waves through the tiny mountain kingdom, which is ringed by South Africa and has a long history of political turmoil.Senior members of the ruling All Basotho Convention (ABC) party accused the prime minister of hampering investigations into the killing.Thabane said last month he would leave office on the grounds of old age, but gave no timeframe for his departure.Hundreds of opposition supporters marched through the streets of Maseru on the day the prime minister was quizzed by police, demanding he step down with immediate effect.Maesiah Thabane was picked up on the border with South Africa following an arrangement between her lawyer and the police.',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian priests should refrain from the practice of blessing nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction that can inflict indiscriminate loss of life, according to new guidelines being discussed by the Russian Orthodox Church. During two decades in power, President Vladimir Putin has aligned himself with the Orthodox Church, which has also developed closer ties with the ministry of defense. Russian priests have long appeared in images sprinkling holy water on submarines, ballistic missiles, Soyuz space rockets and other pieces of hardware as part of rituals to bless them. But some of that is set to stop if the church approves a document drawn up by an Orthodox Church commission. The blessing of military weapons is not reflected in the tradition of the Orthodox Church and does not correspond to the content of the Rite, the document, on the Moscow patriarchates website, says. Blessing or sanctifying weapons that can kill an indefinite number of people must be excluded from pastoral practice, it says.  The proposals will be discussed until June 1 and the public should also take part in the debate, the churchs Moscow branch said. In a striking symbol of close defense-church ties in Russia, the armed forces are building their own sprawling cathedral at a military themed park outside Moscow.

       " 'As the new year dawned, Maria Pardalakis was in the throes of labour. The clock had barely struck midnight when she delivered a healthy boy in a clinic on Crete.With her sons birth  the first in Greece this year  Pardalakis and her husband, Christos, became the first people eligible for a 2,000 (1,700) government baby bonus. Its been a new year like no other, the best gift my wife could give me, Christos enthused. And, sure, the benefit will help  not just us, a lot of families.Athens centre-right government has been galvanised into action on the back of projections that Greeces population of 10.7 million could shrink by a third in the next three decades unless declining birthrates are reversed. At current rates, by 2050, 36% of the population will be above the age of 65, according to Eurostat, a prospect with severe implications for the workforce and a social security system already under strain. In 1970 just 7% of the Greek population was in that age bracket.People might think this is an issue of national pride but its actually one of national preservation, said Domna Michailidou, a former Cambridge University academic and the deputy minister of labour and social affairs, who has pushed for the bonus and other benefits for parents. Given that high productivity rates are associated with young populations and not actively ageing ones, its also an economic growth priority. The picture becomes even more gloomy when compared with the difficult state of our pensions system.Greece is far from alone in facing such demographics. Declining birthrates in Spain, Italy and Cyprus have spurred fears of Europes north-south economic divide deepening, but Greece is also living with the impact of its troubled last decade.Close to 500,000 people emigrated between 2010 and 2015, when unemployment rates nudged a record 28%. Many were young professionals now settled in more prosperous areas of the continent, plus the US, Canada and Australia. Having 5% of our most educated population  people able to earn high incomes and of reproductive age  leave the country has further compounded everything, said Michailidou.Even before Greeces great depression  during which it lost a quarter of its economic output  birthrates had fallen well below replacement level. When crisis hit and stringent cuts were imposed in return for international rescue funds to keep the country afloat and in the eurozone, the health budget fell by more than 40%. The big drop in funding and the effect it had on medical services, especially on islands and in remote mountain areas, created a lot of insecurity in women, said Dr Stefanos Chandakas, a gynaecologist whose NGO, Hope Genesis, focuses on providing free healthcare to pregnant women. Stillbirths increased because many women missed out on crucial prenatal tests and a lot decided to postpone having children at all.Chandakas, a British-trained fertility expert, said that while visiting more than 30 islands at the height of the budget crisis, he and his team were shocked at the lack of pregnant women. Schools, similarly, were bereft of children. At some schools, parades took place with a single child.In the case of Fourni, which has a population of 1,000 people, there were zero births in 2014 and 2015, he recalled. Now that we are offering medical services and have this safety network in place, we are convincing more to have children. Today there are 11 ongoing pregnancies on Fourni.Michailidou, who at 34 is the cabinets youngest member, has championed opening more nurseries and creches. We have to ensure that women re-enter the labour force, she said. I feel very strongly about this. We have seen how in countries like France it works.The policies are the most serious step that Greece has taken to address its demographic problem. The baby bonus is expected to cost 180m a year, equivalent to 0.1% of GDP. It is available to resident non-EU as well as EU citizens, a decision that has raised eyebrows among the more conservative supporters of the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakiss government.Greeces frontline role as an arrival point for Europe-bound migrants and refugees has raised hopes that newcomers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East will further help boost the population. Greece has to accept that in the next 20 years it is going to be multicultural, like other European societies, said Chandakas. Its going to have to adapt, our education system is going to have to change, it will be a challenge for the young as well as old.Greece has the advantage of history on its side, according to George Prevelakis, a professor at the Sorbonne and Greeces permanent representative at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. Greece has repeatedly renewed itself both demographically and economically through migrant waves that were not part of a state plan but the result of geopolitical developments, he said.These included millions of refugees arriving from Turkey in a massive exchange of populations after Greeces disastrous military campaign in Asia Minor in 1922, and an influx of 500,000 Albanians after the collapse of communism.If the Greek government pursues an intelligent migration policy, the country can function as a demographic pump, he said.

       " 'LAGOS (Reuters) - The United States and the British dependency of Jersey have agreed with Nigeria to repatriate more than $300 million in funds stolen by former military ruler General Sani Abacha, the three governments said. Abacha ruled Nigeria, Africas biggest oil producer, from 1993 until his death in 1998. Corruption watchdog Transparency International estimates he stole as much as $5 billion of public money during that time. He was never charged with corruption during his life and Nigeria has been fighting for years to recover the money. Companies linked to the Abacha family have gone to court to prevent repatriation, alleging infringement of their rights to a fair trial. The governments of Nigeria, Jersey and the United States said in a statement they had entered into an asset recovery agreement to repatriate forfeited assets to Nigeria. The Nigerian government pegged the total amount at $321 million. The funds were laundered through the U.S. banking system and then held in bank accounts in Jersey in the name of Doraville Properties Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company, and in the name of the son of the ex-military ruler, they said. This agreement has culminated in a major victory for Nigeria and other African countries as it recognizes that crime does not pay and that it is important for the international community to seek for ways to support sustainable development through the recovery and repatriation of stolen assets, Nigerian Attorney General Abubakar Malami said. Nigeria has been working with governments around the world in recent years on an asset recovery scheme to help repatriate its stolen funds to boost its finances. The government did not state how much in total it believes Abacha stole. As at 2013, Nigeria had recovered about $1.3 billion of Abachas money from various European jurisdictions, with more than a third of that from Switzerland. The Swiss government in 2017 said it would return to Nigeria about $321 million in assets seized from Abachas family via a deal signed with the World Bank. Abachas laundering operation extended to the United States and European jurisdictions such as Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein and Luxembourg, the statement said. His family, which has never admitted nor denied that funds were stolen, could not be reached for comment and their present whereabouts were not known. In a separate news release, the U.S. Department of Justice said it is seeking to enforce forfeiture judgments for approximately $30 million in assets located in Britain and more than $144 million in France.  In 2014 a U.S. court forfeited the money as property involved in the illicit laundering of the proceeds of corruption arising in Nigeria during the five years when Abacha was head of state. Negotiations for repatriation commenced in 2018. The funds would be administered by Nigerias sovereign wealth fund and would be used to develop road infrastructure, that will boost supply chain connections and economic growth, Malami said.

India\\'s fiscal year starts on April 1 and runs through March.In September, Reuters reported the government was considering a special window free of any foreign investment cap for overseas passive investors.An inclusion in global indices would open India\\'s bond market to more investors and potentially reduce the government\\'s borrowing costs.That investment could be significant in the long run, said Ananth Narayan, associate professor of finance at S.P. Jain Institute of Management and Research.However, Narayan said, \"if it is only a few bonds, a full- fledged index inclusion will not happen. We will get a very small, negligible kind of weightage on the index, but it is a good way to start.\"Generally, to include a sovereign bond global indices the issuing country needs to remove all foreign investment caps. But India has negotiated with some operators to open a new category of bonds that would have no caps instead of removing the 6% cap for the entire market, the first official said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman announced plans to fully open a certain category of bonds for foreign investors during her budget speech on Feb. 1, but did not give details such as quantity, timing or tenure.The move would reduce the amount of securities that would need to be bought purely by domestic participants by about 4.5% at the outset. India\\'s total planned borrowing for 2020/21 stands at $109.57 billion.The Indian government is looking for fresh investors as Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans to spend over 100 trillion rupees to build new roads, hospitals, airports and rural infrastructure.Chinese renminbi-denominated government bonds were added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate index in April and the country is predicted to get some $150 billion worth of foreign investment.Several market participants said they expect around $10 billion to $20 billion of inflows if the bonds join a global index. The flows could be much larger if limits on foreign ownership of Indian bonds are completely removed.Both the officials said that the government is in talks with market players to gauge the appetite for such bonds and may also increase the cap for foreign investment for the entire market if warranted in the future.The government is currently working on the tenures of the bonds and could come up with 10-year benchmark bonds in the special category as well, said the first official.',\n",

She adds that a slap can never be an expression of love, ever.\"I think no one takes a stand against the disrespect of women, including women themselves. Standing up against it is the need of the hour. Women who are living in poor economic condition cannot stand up because of their conditioning and financial dependency on their spouses. They have no place to go and they do not earn money, so they deal with disrespect and torture every day. In elite society, they refuse to address the issue only because they look at it as social embarrassment and (feel that) it hampers their image of a perfect family!\" Taapsee told IANS.She added: \"The fact is, whether it is one slap or several more slaps or other acts of domestic violence, it all comes from a place of disrespect and discrimination. There is nothing called a slap out of love. No, never!\"Thappad revolves around a couple whose marriage unravels after the husband slaps his wife in public. The film also features Paveil Gulati, Ratna Pathak Shah, Tanvi Azmi, Dia Mirza, Ram Kapoor and Kumud Mishra among others.The actor believes the first introduction to violence happens through parents and it gets normalised by them. Therefore the actor emphasised on sensible parenting. \"A kid is slapped by an elder because of the elder wants to create fear in the child\\'s mind, because the child is comparatively weak. It is the wrong style of parenting. Since childhood, the human mind learns to normalise a few acts of physical violence like slapping or raising a hand. In adulthood, men especially use the same habits to control people. It is a cycle and we need to question it,\" she said.Taapsee did a dozen-odd glamour roles in southern commercial films before Pink changed the tide of her career in 2016, and she carved her image as a serious actor in Bollywood. In a short time, she has crafted for a \"no-nonsense\" image on and off the screen with films like Naam Shabana, Soorma, Mulk, Badla among others.Taapsee said that playing the protagonist Amrita in Thappad was a huge challenge. \"The character Amrita was suffocating for me in the end and I took it as a challenge. After 15 days of shooting, I started feeling claustrophobic. It was tough for me to get out of my firebrand image and mindspace and get into the skin of this character,\" she said.She describes Amrita as a \"good-hearted, loving and homely girl\", who finally decides to walk out of a relationship that she invested all her emotions in. \"She took all the typical nonsense of \\'girls should compromise\\', \\'little physical violence is part of love\\', \\'and girl should do everything to save the marriage\\'. As Taapsee, I cannot take such nonsense at all. So, emotionally I was feeling claustrophobic,\" she shared.Directed by Anubhav Sinha, Thappad is scheduled to release on February 28.Follow @htshowbiz for more',\n",

On their phones, police found pictures of a silicone mask of Prince Albert II of Monaco, suggesting they were planning another hoax.Seven men go on trial on Tuesday. Six of the defendants, including Chikli and Lasarevitsch, are charged over both the Le Drian scam and the suspected plot to target Prince Albert, while the seventh is charged solely over the alleged Monaco plot.Prosecutors say the Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims, was conned by a Le Drian impersonator in 2016 and made five transfers totalling 20m to Poland and China. Three of the payments were frozen, but 7.7m disappeared.A few months later, the Turkish business magnate nan Kra was allegedly convinced to wire more than $47m (36m) for what he thought was ransom money for two journalists held hostage in Syria.Others targeted, unsuccessfully, included Gabons president, Ali Bongo, the French Aids charity Sidaction, the CEO of the Lafarge cement company and the archbishop of Paris.The phoney Le Drian even tried to convince the Tunisian government to buy four Airbus Tigre attack helicopters for 19m.Chikli and Lasarevitsch deny the charges.But in an interview with French television in 2010 over previous scams, Chikli said he was intrigued by the game of scamming. Youve either got the gift or you havent. Its like famous actors. When it comes to me, you can say that I have a gift, he said.His story inspired a 2015 film, Je Compte Sur Vous (Im Counting on You), with the French actor Vincent Elbaz in the starring role.',\n",

Consolidated revenue from operations rose by 8.5% to  21,947 crore.In December, the company increased tariffs by as much as 40% and raised the minimum monthly recharge for prepaid users to  45.Mobile revenue grew, led by a strong focus on quality users, and in some part, benefitted by the recent tariff actions although the full impact of the tariff actions is yet to be seen, the company said.The earnings announcement comes two weeks after the apex court agreed to hear Airtels modification plea filed after the court ordered the company on 24 October to pay  35,586 crore of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues by 23 January to the government.In the September quarter, the company reported a record loss after having to set aside  28,450 crore towards dues related to license fees and spectrum usage charges, including penalties and interest costs.During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the group has continued to recognize, in the same manner, its obligations under the judgements/orders. Accordingly, during the quarter, the group has further recorded interest of  1,048.1 crore, which has been presented as exceptional item,\" the company said.Besides Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices have also filed pleas to seek more time to pay dues related to the courts order on how revenue should be calculated, based on which operators pay levies.The telcos want to negotiate a sustainable payment schedule with the telecom department, which has issued demand notices worth over  1 trillion for revenue share, interest, and penalty.To be sure, Airtel, last month, raised  21,502 crore through a mix of equity and debt to pay the dues.Pursuant to the infusion of fresh equity and long-term financing via convertible bonds subsequent to the reporting period ended December 31, 2019 and available liquidity/facilities with the group, the management has concluded that the previously reported material uncertainty on the groups ability to continue as a going concern no longer exists,\" Airtel said.Airtels monthly average revenue per user from mobile services in India rose to  135 in the December quarter from  128 in the September quarter. On this metric, it beat Jio which recorded an average revenue per user of  128.4 in the December quarter.While tariff revision undertaken in December 2019 is a welcome step towards repairing the financial health of the industry, we believe tariffs must go up further for enabling the industry to invest in emerging technologies,\" Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said in a statement.',\n",

The states health minister KK Shailaja, who is leading the battle, spoke with Ramesh Babu.Here are the excerpts:Q: With three coronavirus cases detected in the state, what is the ground situation?A. We have declared a state calamity. It is not to trigger panic but to create more awareness and care. Two thousand two hundred and thirty-nine persons are under observation and 84 are admitted to various hospitals. Enough isolation wards are ready. Despite our vigilance, it is sad some returnees dodge health officials. It is really dangerous. If they continue to do this we will treat it as a crime.

       " 'Danish police have frozen a 14.7m mansion near Hyde Park, in central London, owned by Sanjay Shah, a British multi-millionaire businessman accused of defrauding Danish taxpayers out of 1.5bn.Denmarks serious economic and international crime police department said on Monday it had frozen the property owned by a suspect believed to have scammed more than 12bn Danish kroner (1.5bn). The Danish authorities did not identify the suspect.However, the Guardian can confirm that the property is owned by Sanjay Shah, a 50-year-old former hedge fund boss who is living in Dubai. Denmark has been pursuing Shah for five years over a complex tax fraud.A spokesman for Shah, who lives on a private island in Dubais Palm Jumeirah development, confirmed that his London mansion had been frozen.The spokesman, Jack Irvine, said it was mysterious that Denmark had announced the freezing today given that the authorities took control of the house months ago. Irvine said Shah denies any wrongdoing. The claims are subject to a civil case at Londons high court brought against Shah by Denmarks tax authority, Skat.In a high court filing in 2018, Shah was described by Skat as the primary individual said to be responsible for the fraudulent scheme. Irvine said Shah, who was born in London, would not return to the UK to give evidence, fearing extradition to Denmark.Shah has entertained global superstars in Dubai, where he used to drive around in a white Rolls Royce.He established Autism Rocks, a charity he set up to raise money for autism research, and put on charity concerts featuring artists including Elton John, Snoop Dogg, Prince, Ed Sheeran and Jennifer Lopez. He also founded a festival in Dubai called Blended, which has featured the BackStreet Boys, Melanie C and Lemar. He is said to own a total of six homes on the Palm Jumeirah, where he had also moored a 1m yacht.I regret buying my yacht, he told the United Arab Emirates newspaper The National in 2017. It cost 1m and, like a brand-new car, youve lost half the value as soon as you try to sell it. Its moored on the Palm Jumeirah, not far from us, and I have a licence to sail, but its far enough that we have to drive to it in summer, remember to take food and drink with us, hire a captain and deck hand for the day if I dont want to sail myself, and plan around the kids activities at the weekend  Its for sale, but no one is buying. Irvine said he had subsequently sold the yacht.Shah is accused by Denmark of making bogus claims via his hedge fund Solo Capital, which defrauded the Danish tax office out of 1.5bn between 2012 and 2015. The UKs National Crime Agency (NCA) raided the offices of Solo Capital in 2016. The hedge fund has closed down.The NCAs director of investigations, Nikki Holland, said: The NCA conducted an initial investigation into an alleged fraud to the value of over 1 bn committed against the Danish and Belgian tax authorities between 2012 and 2015.It was agreed, with the support of the Crown Prosecution Service, that investigative challenges would prevent the NCA being able to present evidence which would have a realistic possibility of leading to a prosecution in the UK. This case was transferred to the Danish authorities in October 2019, and we continue to provide support as required. This article was amended on 6 February 2020 because an earlier version referred to Shahs mansion being seized, as the English translation of the Danish State Prosecutors Office notice said.

The abrogation of Article 370, triple talaq and CAA are its examples, he said.The new joinee also spoke about Shaheen Bagh, the colony in southwest Delhi which has been a site of protests against the amended citizenship act for more than a month now.Those who are fuelling protest at Shaheen Bagh are the same people who were praising China in 1962 And, if we do not come forward to support Prime Minister Modiji now we will not be able to control the fire that is raging today, he said.I just want to ask the Muslim women protesters in Shaheen Bagh one question. Did anyone before PM Modi take the decision to end the historic decision to do away with triple talaq?

Now they were delaying execution of the penalty decided by the courts on one excuse or the other.The four men - gym instructor Vinay Sharma, bus cleaner Akshay Kumar Thakur, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta and unemployed Mukesh Singh - had been sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a 23-year old paramedic student inside a moving bus in December 2012. The gruesome crime had sparked nationwide protests over increasing sexual violence and forced the government to revisit laws.Sanjay Singh, who referred to the public outrage and street protests that had followed the gang rape, said the men were convicted by a fast-track court but it had taken years to enforce the verdict. In the higher courts, Singh said, the case has only been getting deferred from one date to another.They have no right to be alive, he said, urging the House to seek the intervention of the President and Supreme Court for speedy execution of the death sentence.A Delhi court, after having twice issued the black warrant for their execution, declined to issue a third one last week, pointing that all the convicts were entitled to exhaust their legal options.Over the weekend, the Delhi High Court held a special hearing at the request of the Centre which wanted orders to hang the convicts who had exhausted their appeals and mercy petition. It is yet to deliver its ruling.The Centres second most-senior law officer Tushar Mehta, had argued that the convicts were trying to frustrate the mandate of the law in a deliberate calculated actionPresident Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the mercy petition of two convicts, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur. The mercy plea of the third death row convict Akshay Thakur is pending. The fourth convict is yet to file the mercy petition.Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said the delay in hanging the convicts was a sensitive issue but blamed the AAP-led city government for the delay. The Supreme Court rejected the appeals of the convicts more than a year ago but Tihar jail delayed their execution. This delay is due to the state government, Javadekar said.Rajya Sabha chairman Naidu, however, told members not to politicise the issue. No politics no discussion, he told members.',\n",

       " 'A week-long dream hunt with the US presidents son Donald Trump Jr is being auctioned at an annual trophy hunting convention in Reno, Nevada alongside expeditions to shoot elephants, bears and giraffes.The four-day event organized by Safari Club International (SCI) and advertised as a hunters heaven, will culminate on Saturday with an auction for a week-long Sitka black-tailed deer hunt in Alaska with Trump Jr, his son and a guide. At the time of writing, bidding for the yacht-based expedition stands at $10,000 (7,685).Other prizes include the chance to shoot an elephant on a 14-day trip in Namibia, an all-inclusive hunt package to Zimbabwe to kill buffalo, giraffe and wildebeest, and a 10-day crocodile hunting expedition in South Africa. The proceeds from the auction, which campaigners say could exceed $5m, will fund SCIs hunter advocacy and wildlife conservation efforts, according to the organization.Thousands of hunters from around the world are expected to attend the convention which begins on Wednesday, where Trump Jr, an avid trophy hunter, is set to give a keynote address.The description of the auction prize states: This year we will be featuring Donald Trump Jr, a man who needs no introduction, and whose passion for the outdoors makes him the number one ambassador for our way of life.Don Jr shares this heritage with his son and believes in handing down these lessons to young hunters. Don Jr and his son will be hosting this years hunt along with Keegan [the guide] in Alaska.It comes just weeks after ProPublica revealed Trump Jr killed a rare species of endangered sheep during a hunting trip to Mongolia last summer.Last week, anti-hunting campaigners condemned the annual SCI convention, and Brian Wilson and Al Jardine backed a boycott of their former band the Beach Boys, who are scheduled to appear at the event.Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said: This annual event is the largest meeting in the world of people who celebrate the senseless killing, buying and selling of dead animals for bragging rights.As our planet suffers an extinction crisis, it is business as usual for the trophy hunting industry and SCI, who continue to revel in spending millions of dollars every year to destroy imperiled wildlife.SCI hit back at the criticisms and called them the height of hypocrisy, arguing that hunting makes enormous contributions to conservation and described Trump Jr as an accomplished conservationist.The regulations around importing hunting trophies has been loosened under Donald Trump, though he has previously described the practice as a horror show despite his sons affection for big-game hunting. In 2018 the administration moved to make it easier to import trophies from exotic big-game animals such as elephants and lions.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features',\n",
       " 'JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African court issued an arrest warrant for former president Jacob Zuma on Tuesday, after he skipped court on grounds of needing medical treatment, but the judge stayed the warrant until his corruption trial resumes on May 6. Zumas lawyer presented the judge with a sick note from what he said was a military hospital, but Judge Dhaya Pillay questioned whether the note was valid, as there was no medical number showing if and where the doctor was certified. I dont even know if [he] ... is a doctor. There is ... nothing to suggest that he is, she said, before issuing the warrant. The former leader is on trial on 18 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a $2 billion arms deal with French defense firm Thales in 1999, when Zuma was deputy president. He rejects the allegations as a politically motivated witch-hunt.  Dan Mantsha, Zumas lawyer, said that he was abroad for medical treatment, without saying where. Local media have suggested he is in Cuba, although it was not immediately possible to verify this.  Pillay concluded that the note was insufficient to excuse Zuma from appearing for the trial, but gave him until it resumes on May 6 to turn up before the warrant kicks in.  Zuma, president from 2009-2018, had previously applied for a permanent stay of prosecution but the court in Pietermaritzburg threw out his appeal in November. He is accused of accepting 500,000 rand ($34,000) annually from Thales in 1999, in exchange for protecting the company from an investigation into the deal. Thales, known as Thompson-CSF at the time, has said it had no knowledge of any transgressions by any of its employees in relation to the award of the contracts. The National Prosecuting Authority initially filed the charges against Zuma a decade ago, but set them aside shortly before he successfully ran for president in 2009. Following appeals and lobbying by opposition parties, the NPA reinstated the charges in March 2018. Pillay also accepted an application by the company on Tuesday to be represented by lawyer Barry Roux, who defended Paralympian athlete Oscar Pistorius over the 2013 murder of his girlfriend.

       " 'Hair tied like a Samurais bun, S Mirabai Chanu switched on her game face, rubbed hands and strode into the arena to attempt breaking her snatch national record of 87kg by 1kg. A scream of exhortation and she squatted, gripping the bar.The silence at Khudiram Anushilan Kendravenue for the senior national weightlifting championshipswas broken by some muttering paarbe, (she can) twice. In her second attempt, having started with a successful lift of 85 kg, Mirabai, 25, didnt disappoint.Amid applause, she smiled and stepped away. Next target: 90kg. This time she failed but given that K Sanjita Chanu was second best at 80kg, it didnt matter in the race for the womens 49kg gold.On her four-feet-nine-inch frame rests hope of an Olympic medal, so it wasnt surprising that Mirabai would be competing against herself. In clean and jerk, she started with a lift of 111kg and upped her second attempt to 115kg to again break her national record. Her aggregate now stood at 203, better than her national record of 201kg achieved at last years world championships and enough to seal the first place. Mirabai set the weight at 117kg for her final attempt. This she couldnt lift.There was a slight pull which caused a problem in receiving (placing the bar on her shoulders), said Mirabai. But I am happy. I came here with a target of going beyond 200kg.This (117kg) is not the kind of weight you attempt to touch regularly at training because it increases the risk of injury, said Vijay Sharma, the national coach who has been training Mirabai since 2014.With the bronze medal at the world championships going at 204kgto North Koreas Ri Song GumMirabai knows she has work to do. My target is 210kg120 in clean and jerk and 90 in snatch. I want to get there at the Asian Championships, which is the last qualifying event for the Olympics, said the 2017 world 48kg champion.The Asian championships will be from April 16-25 in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. Adding 7kg in aggregate would need intensity in her training upped from the current 80-85% to 90%, she said.Managing weight is the biggest challenge. When you try and control eating to keep the weight down, you feel weak. You need to avoid oil, eat boiled, even if it is fish or red meat, she said.For now, erombathe chutney comprising mashed potato, bamboo shoots and dried fish that is really strong on spicesis the staple of a Manipuri Meiteis diet and Mirabais favourite food will have to wait. Not that I dont miss it sometimes. But then, a chance to do something for India awaits, she said.Our target here was to get between 203kg and 205kg so things are going as per plan. I will be happy if she can get to 206-207kg at the Asian championships. There are little tweaks in technique that have to be made and some strength issues that need to be addressed and we have a few weeks to do that, said Sharma.He said they will train in Patiala now and head to Kazakhstan some 15 days before the championships.A camp of 20 days in Tokyo before the Games too is planned, said Sahdev Yadav, general secretary of the Indian Weightlifting Federation.Mirabai had a miserable 2016 Olympics, failing in all clean-and-jerk attempts in the 48kgthe weights have since been revised and she had to move up to 49kg. Since then I have been thinking about making amends in Tokyo, said the weightlifter who lists 2000 Olympics bronze medallist Karnam Malleswarithe only Indian weightlifter to have got the podium so farand Kunjarani Devi, a multiple medallist at world championships, as role models.The Chinese have been doing 208-210 kg for the past four years. (Jiang Huihua won gold at 212 kg and Hou Zhuhui silver at 211kg at the world championships). We started from 194kg (the aggregate that fetched Mirabai gold in the 2017 world championships) so we are running our own race. If we hasten, it could lead to injury. I believe between 207-210 kg we will get an (Olympic) medal. The rest is up to luck and god, said Sharma.',\n",

They also come after Raj Thackeray in January sought the eviction of Bangladeshi and Pakistani Muslims from the country. He had also indicated support to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), announcing a march at Azad Maidan on February 9 against those protesting the Centres move.The number of Bangladeshi immigrants has been on the rise in the region of late. However, there has not been commensurate action against them as was expected, a local MNS leader, Mahesh Jadhav, said.For Maharashtra and Hindu dharma, if we have to take law in our hands, we will ensure that Bangladeshi Muslim and Pakistani Muslims flee from here. It would be good if the administration acts before the February 9 rally of Raj sahib in Mumbai, he added.Sudhir Navle, another leader said, We have learnt that illegal Bangladeshi immigrant workers are hired as they provide cheap labour. They are given accommodation and food. They are also settled here based on bogus documents.The administration needs to take strict action in the matter. These illegal immigrants should get out of Panvel or else they will be taught a lesson in MNS style, he added.Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II), Ashok Dudhe said they have been taking regular action against illegal immigrants, including Bangladesh nationals, in the city. Seventy-seven Bangladeshi nationals have been deported from the city in the last two years. We shall continue our drive against illegal immigrants in the city. Nobody will be allowed to take law in their hands. We are equipped for any eventuality, Dudhe said.Twenty-three illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were arrested and 18 deported in 2018 while the numbers rose to 47 and 59 respectively in 2019.I had issued instructions to conduct a special drive to find illegal immigrants in the city.

State media did not immediately name Rahimpours lawyer.However, a report by the state-run IRNA news agency alleged that Rahimpour received money from the CIA to share details of Irans nuclear program.While being in touch with the spy agency, he earned a lot of money as wages as he tried to deliver some information from Irans nuclear program to the American agency, the IRNA report said. Rahimpour had been identified and prosecuted and sentenced to death and recently, the countrys National Supreme Court confirmed the sentence and, God willing, he will be punish soon.The CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Esmaili said two other alleged spies for the CIA each received 15-year prison sentences  10 years for spying and five years for acting against national security charges.Esmaili did not name those arrested, only saying they worked in the charitable field, without elaborating.Iran in the past has sentenced alleged American and Israeli spies to death. The last such spy executed was Shahram Amiri, who defected to the U.S. at the height of Western efforts to thwart Irans nuclear program. When he returned in 2010, he was welcomed with flowers by government leaders and even went on the Iranian talk-show circuit. Then he mysteriously disappeared.He was hanged in August 2016, the same week that Tehran executed a group of militants and a year after Iran agreed to a landmark accord to limit uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.Tensions remain high between Iran and the U.S. since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehrans nuclear deal. A U.S. drone strike in January killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, a targeted killing that prompted Tehran to launch a retaliatory ballistic missile strike on Iraqi bases housing American troops.Before the deal, a computer virus believed to be designed by the U.S. and Israel destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Meanwhile, Iranian nuclear scientists were targeted in a series of assassinations.___Associated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyas longest-serving president Daniel Arap Moi, whose rule was marred by corruption and torture of opponents, died on Tuesday, the office of the president said. He was 95. There was no immediate explanation for Mois death, but he had been in and out of hospital with breathing problems in recent months. Plaudits poured in from Kenyan politicians, but some of his victims were less forgiving.  Our nation and our continent were immensely blessed by the dedication and service of the late ... Moi, who spent almost his entire adult life serving Kenya and Africa, President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a statement.  Moi died peacefully in hospital at 5.20 a.m. (0220 GMT), surrounded by his family, said his son Gideon Moi, a senator. Moi came to power in 1978, when he was serving as vice-president and the nations first leader President Jomo Kenyatta died. He remained in power until the end of 2002 when his constitutional term ran out. Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Jomo Kenyatta, was Mois preferred successor but lost the election to the opposition. Uhuru Kenyatta became president in 2013. Moi is credited for keeping Kenya relatively stable compared with its troubled neighbors, and he worked for peace in the region. But he oversaw massive corruption scandals that are still costing Kenyan taxpayers. One scandal, Goldenberg, led to the loss of at least $1 billion in central bank money via compensation payments for bogus gold and diamond exports. The economy stagnated under Moi, leaving millions mired in poverty. Diplomats said an attempted coup in 1982 transformed Moi from a cautious, insecure leader into a tough autocrat.  Moi rewrote the constitution to legalize de facto one-party rule, which secured power for his Kenya African National Union (KANU) until 1991, when Moi caved in to international pressure to reintroduce multi-party politics. His government set up interrogation chambers in the basement of Nyayo House, a government building in central Nairobi that now houses the immigration department. Thousands of activists, students and academics were held without charge in the underground cells, some of them partly filled with water. Prisoners say they were sometimes denied food and water and beaten to confess fictitious crimes or just for revenge.  There remains the legacy of disappearances and unexplained deaths, detention without trial, repression of freedom of expression and the media, said human rights lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, who was held in solitary confinement for two years. I never knew if I was going to make it out alive - I still carry scars. Some people were not as lucky as I am. They died. These are the people we need to remember. Moi barely survived demands for his resignation over the 1990 murder of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, an important Luo leader. In 2010, a government inquiry into the death, presented to parliament five years after it was written, said the murder was carried out in one of Mois official residences.

Two of the hikers were injured when the hut they were sheltering in was hit by a landslide.Officials on Tuesday began checking among those rescued to confirm that everyone on the trails had been accounted for.Nearly 400 others  including 195 tourists  are trapped in the nearby township of Milford Sound and will have to wait until at least Wednesday to be rescued after flooding cut off the highway in and out of the town.The weather chaos in the picturesque Fiordland area of Southland  at the bottom of the South Island  hit during the peak summer tourist season and generated a state of emergency for the region.Weve got quite widespread flooding across the whole region, said Angus McKay, the group controller for Emergency Management Southland. Its exceptional even for a very wet place.Fiordland is deluged by about 10 metres of rain a year  and 1.1 metres had fallen in the past three days alone.The tourists stuck in Milford Sound were safest there, McKay said, because so many highways were closed.

       " 'Islamabad:In yet another bid to provoke the people of Kashmir, calls for \\'jihad\\' against India were made in Pakistan Assembly by some political outfits on Monday. A political leader went on to suggest that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan declare February 10 as the date of war against India.As per Pakistan\\'s publication Dawn, members of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) urged the Pakistan government to declare jihad against India. JUI-F leader Maulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali even suggested that PM Imran Khan should announce that Pakistan would start a war with India after February 10.Maulana Chitrali also opined that mere announcement of war with India would force the international community to intervene and resolve the decades-old Kashmir issue between the two countries.Chitrali\\'s call for Jihad against India was welcomed by several leaders in the Pakistan National Assembly yesterday.Other leaders in the Pakistan Assembly asserted that war is the only option available in order to \"liberate the people of Kashmir and to complete the unfinished plan of the subcontinent\\'s partition.Parliamentary leader of the main opposition Khawaja Asif lashed out against the other Islamic countries accusing them of doing nothing for the people of Kashmir.Asif went on to add that Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) is a \"dead organisation and apart from three-four member countries, rest of the nations could not even defend themselves, so how would they talk about Kashmir\".After the three-hour-long Assembly session, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan got emotional and urged the country to \"come up with a plan to attack India and take Jammu and Kashmir\". PM Imran Khan is yet to respond on the calls for jihad against India.Fall out since abrogation of Article 370Back on August 5, 2019, the Indian government decided to abrogate Article 370 that granted special status to the erstwhile stateof Jammu and Kashmir. The state was further bifurcated into two new Union Territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.The revocation of the special status has brought the Kashmir Valley under the ambit of Indian Constitution, which has apparently left Pakistan perplexed.

       " 'This years Delhi assembly election will see the highest share of candidates with declared criminal cases in over a decade, according to figures by election watchdog Association for Democratic Reforms based on analysis of affidavits filed by the candidates with the Election Commission of India. Twenty of these candidates have been convicted in at least one case. The election will also see the highest share of crorepatis, higher-educated, women and older candidates in over a decade.Of the 672 candidates contesting the election, nearly 20% have a criminal case against them. This is the highest share of such candidates at least since the 2008 assembly elections, when the figure was nearly 14%, and has since been increasing in every consecutive election. This is in harmony with the nationwide trend of increasing criminalisation in politicsin the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the share of candidates with criminal cases was the highest in a decade.Not all candidates have cases of a serious nature against them. But the share of candidates with serious criminal cases has also been growing over time. This year, more than 15% of candidates have criminal cases of serious nature against them, also the highest since 2008. (Chart 1)These include cases such as those related to murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping, rape and other crimes against women. This year, 32 candidates have cases related to crimes against women, one of them for rape, while four candidates have cases related to attempt to murder. Eight candidates have a case related to hate speech.The overall figure of 20% of candidates having criminal cases against them hides the fact that big political parties have a larger share of such candidates. 60%candidates of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have self-declared criminal cases against them. This figure is nearly 39% for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 27% for the Congress.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has the highest number of criminal cases, 13.The AAP said the criminal cases against its candidates, including Kejriwal, are all an outcome of the political vendetta by the Centre. It is not hidden from the people of Delhi the Centre has been after the AAP ever since it came to power in 2015. They slapped cases after cases against Kejriwal, other ministers like Satyendar Jain and Kailash Gahlot, and many more AAP MLAs. They even raided Kejriwals home. Each attempt has miserably failed as no case could last in the court of law, said AAP Delhi unit convener Gopal Rai.Of all the candidates contesting the election, 36% are crorepatis, the highest in four assembly elections. This figure is higher for the three big parties -- 83% candidates of the Congress, 73% of AAP and 70% of the BJP are crorepatis.Four wealthiest candidates are from AAP. Dharampal Lakra, the AAP candidate from Mundka constituency, is an outlier with 292 crore worth of assets, nearly four times more than the total assets of the second wealthiest candidate Pramila Tokas, the AAP candidate from RK Puram constituency, who owns assets worth 81 crore.The election this year also has the highest share of women candidates (11.8%) since 2008. Fifteen percent of the Congress candidates are women compared to 13% of AAP and 9% of the BJP.The election will also see a slightly smaller share of younger candidates compared to the previous three elections. This year only 8.5% of candidates are up to 30 years old while 27.5% of candidates are between 31 and 40 years old. This is the lowest since 2008. On the contrary, there is a higher share of candidates who are more than 50 years old. (Chart 2)The share of higher-educated candidates has increased. Forty-five per cent candidates contesting thiselection are at least graduates. This figure was 40% in 2015, 36% in 2013 and 32% in 2008. The share of literate but uneducated candidates has decreased in this period. (Chart 3)We gave maximum seats to women and candidates from the Sikh communities unlike other parties. Besides, AAP and BJP have the highest number of candidates with criminal cases. In the Congress, the candidates who may have cases against them are mostly political rather than being criminal, said Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra.Former Delhi BJP chief Vijay Goel said, As far as representation to women is concerned, we have given an almost equal number of tickets as other political parties have. We might have given one or two tickets less.',\n",

Slamming the party he broke ties with to form a government in Maharashtra, Thackeray said, \"Fadnavisbroke other parties and got their leaders with him. Why didn\\'t merge with the entire party only? These leaders have a different ideology?\"On ideological difference with the parties he has formed an alliance with, Thackeray said people speak about ideology differences between three parties. At the Centre also there are such differences in ideology. Nitish Kumar thinks differently from the BJP but they are together. Chandrababu Naidu was with them. Mamata Banerjee was also at a point of time was part of alliances. Do their ideologies match? What happened in Kashmir? They held discussions with separatists.\"',\n",

Imam was also making efforts to provoke people by alleging that Muslims were being put in the detention camps and killed in Assam.He reportedly told the minority community that it was on the radar of the government and also raked up the issues of Babri Masjid demolition, and Jammu and Kashmir.It has come to light that the JNU student had distributed pamphlets with misleading information on CAA and NRC at mosques on December 14. It is to be noted that the violence in and outside Jamia Millia University campus occurred on December 15. The copy of the pamphlet has been found from Imam\\'s laptop, which police recovered from his Delhi accommodation.Heres how the pamphlet read: \"The Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed last week. This law is unconstitutional and intends to discriminate Muslim and put them in detention camps. It has started in Assam and will follow elsewhere. Muslims across India must reject NRC and CAB in one voice. Kashmir, Babri and now CAB, there are more than enough grounds for a strong reaction from Muslims across India. Assam has started burning and the people are being killed. But the role played by our religious and political leadership has also been disappointing. Thousands of Muslim youths are ready to disrupt Delhi, which will attract international media attention to our issue. The students of Jamia Millia Islamia have given a protest call from the Jamia Jama Masjid. We Muslim students of JNU, request you to join the protest in large numbers and plan for a disruptive chakka-jam.The pamphlet was written in English as well as the Urdu language.A Delhi Police team had arrested Sharjeel Imam from his village in Jehanabad district of Bihar on January 28. On Monday, his custody was extended for three days.Sharjeel Imam had on January 13 delivered a provocative speech, the video of which had gone viral. In thepurported video, Imam was seen talking about splitting the Northeast from India in order to obstruct the NRC\\'s implementation.\"We know how Muslims are being treated in Assam. We have to save people from the NRC. The only way to do this is by cutting off northeast from India,\" he had purportedly said.As his seditious and inflammatory speech went viral, Imam went into hiding to evade arrest.

Today I rise to speak of betrayal. And this betrayal is not just for myself. I was not part of 31 per cent who voted for you in 2014 and 37 per cent who voted for you in 2019. This is not about people like me. I was sceptical about you, your ideology, your rhetoric right from the word go. In a sense, you owe me little. The truth is you have betrayed the very citizen who did vote for you, she said.Moitra said the BJP did not come to power only on votes of the Hindu right but because a very large section of ordinary people, the aspirational middle-of-the-road voters cast aside whatever reservations they might have had about your past and believed in the slogan of  Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.She said these were not hard-core believers but they still believed you, they voted for you.You have betrayed the young voters looking forward to their first job. You have betrayed small businessmen by your decision of demonetisation killing his market, she said.She accused the government of questioning the citizenship of the people who had voted for it.The middle-of-road voters who cannot recognise the India they are living in, cannot recognise the images they see on TV screens, she said and accused the members of the ruling party of spewing hate-filled invective.She also mentioned the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp and said all holocaust memorials serve one reminder that it could happen again.NPR, NRC, and CAA are all tools in Machevillian design to first mark out and then disenfranchise and finally annihilate.

My friends who voted for you in 2014 are horrified by what is happening in their name under your watch, she said.She accused the BJP of demonising dissent and forgetting dharma.Moitra also objected to BJP choosing its MP Parvesh Sahib Singh as its first speaker in the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the Presidents Address, saying that he had been barred from campaigning for 96 hours by the poll panel.

       " 'Hong Kong reported its first death from the coronavirus and four major Chinese cities hundreds of miles from the centre ordered lockdowns as concerns about the spread of the disease mounted.The countrys leadership admitted shortcomings in its handling of the outbreak, with the number of infections and deaths still mounting daily. The death toll inside China has passed 420 and Britain has advised its citizens to leave the country.A 39-year-old man with an underlying health condition died in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, according to the public broadcaster RTHK.His death is the second outside the mainland after a Chinese national from Wuhan was confirmed on Sunday to have died in the Philippines.China announced 64 more deaths on Tuesday  surpassing Mondays record to confirm the biggest daily increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central province of Hubei.The virus is officially calledSars-CoV-2 and this causes the disease Covid-19. It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples  severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus can causepneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Chinas national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outsideChina, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend.There are nine cases of the virus in the UK. Four were located in Brighton, one in London. At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative. Of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.We dont yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we wont know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about400,000 deathseach year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. TheNHS advisesthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GPs surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is the worldwide spread of a disease. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHOs list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a window of opportunity to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Sarah BoseleyHealth editor andHannah DevlinThe virus has killed at least 426 people, exceeding the 349 mainland deaths from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-03, which killed nearly 800 globally.The total number of infections in China also rose, to more than 20,000. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the crisis a global health emergency, with at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions.The vast majority of cases are still concentrated in and around Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital, which has been on lockdown for nearly two weeks. But with increasing numbers of infections registered in other parts of China, some of the worst-hit areas are also bringing in radical measures.Several cities in Zhejiang, a coastal province with a strong trade and manufacturing heritage, have shut schools, businesses, markets and shopping centres, cut off most public transport and barred residents from leaving their homes except to buy necessities or seek medical treatment.The coastal city of Wenzhou, hundreds of miles east of Wuhan, was the first to bring in special measures, Reuters reported. On Sunday it had 291 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the highest number of any city outside Hubei.Since then the city of Taizhou, and several districts in the cities of Ningbo and historic Hangzhou have also been locked down. They include the base of the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, city officials said.The virus is taking an increasing economic toll, shutting businesses, curbing international travel and affecting production lines of global brands.Chinas currency and stock markets steadied in choppy trade after anxiety over the virus hit the yuan on Monday and erased about 308bn in market value from Shanghais benchmark index. Macau, the worlds biggest gambling hub, said it had asked all casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks to help curb the spread of the virus.Wuhan, a bustling industrial hub where the virus first infected humans, has been turned into a near ghost town as a de facto quarantine continues.Residents say they are unable to find hospitals to care for their sick relatives. Several hospitals require patients to first get a referral from local community health centres, many of which are also overwhelmed. As the city remains under lockdown, with public transport and roads shut, people are also struggling to get to health facilities.Authorities have been racing to build two hospitals to treat the infected. The first of those  a 1,000-bed facility  began to receive patients on Monday, the Peoples Daily reported, only 10 days after construction began. A second hospital is due to open this week.Authorities in Wuhan have also started converting a gymnasium, exhibition centre and cultural complex into makeshift hospitals with more than 3,400 beds for patients with mild infections, the official Changjiang Daily said.As the crisis has developed, people from Wuhan and Hubei have faced increasing discrimination in other parts of the country. Many say they have been kicked out or turned away from hotels. Passengers on a flight from Japan to Shanghai in late January reportedly refused to board a flight that had passengers from Wuhan on it. Neighbourhood committees have placed signs on the doors of those recently returned from the province advising other residents not to visit them.Experts say much is still unknown about the pathogen. The mortality rate for the new coronavirus is lower than the 9.6% rate for Sars, but it appears to be more contagious. Reports of deaths not counted in official statistics have also cast doubt on the mortality rate.Such uncertainties have spurred extreme measures by some countries to stem the spread. On Tuesday the UK urged all its citizens to leave China if they can, while Australia sent hundreds of evacuees to a remote island in the Indian Ocean, and Japan ordered the quarantine of a cruise ship with more than 3,000 onboard after a Hong Kong man who sailed on it last month tested positive for the virus. France recommended that its citizens  particularly those with families  should leave China temporarily, and recommended against all but essential travel to the country.There have been 15 confirmed cases in Hong Kong, where authorities announced new border closures after hundreds of medical workers went on strike on Monday over the governments refusal to stop travellers from mainland China.Late on Monday, Chinas elite Politburo Standing Committee called for improvements to the national emergency management system following shortcoming and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who led the meeting, said the outbreak was a major test of Chinas system and ability to govern.',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI :Buyers of loss-making airline Air India and oil firm Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will not get a free hand to shed excess workforce as the government will build in certain protection to employees in the share sale agreement, DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said.Public sector companies often have more people on rolls than their private sector counterparts and companies wanting to take them over would likely right-size them to remove inefficiencies.In an interview with PTI, the Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) said the government will follow a two-stage bidding process for selling its entire holding in Air India and BPCL.First preliminary interest from potential bidders is invited, followed by them being given access of data room on the companies for due diligence. In the second stage, price bids are invited.While in the case of Air India, the expression of interest (EoI) has been invited by March 17, an offer seeking the same for BPCL is likely to be floated in the next few days.Asked if the bidders will get a free hand to right-size the companies after the acquisition, Pandey said, \"There will be certain protection to employees and there will be other conditionalities and this will be listed out in the share purchase agreement (SPA).\"He did not give details of the conditionalities. An SPA will signed with the acquirer who offers the highest bid for buying out government stake.The government is selling its entire 100% stake in Air India but wants effective control to stay with Indian nationals. The airline, which started as a Tata Airlines in 1932 and was later acquired by the government, has not made profits since 2007. It has a total debt of Rs60,074 crore, of which bidder has to takeover Rs23,286.5 crore.In the case of BPCL, the government is selling its entire 53.29% stake in the company that will give buyers ready access to 14% of India\\'s oil refining capacity and about one-fifth of the fuel market share in the world\\'s fastest-growing energy market.\"There is a two-stage process. There will be EoI and request for proposal or RFP (in the first stage) and due diligence-cum-bidding stage (in the second),\" Pandey said. \"After the bidding stage, the highest bidder (will be identified). The highest bidder meeting the reserve price will sign the SPA.\"Asked about concerns over valuation of BPCL, he said DIPAM has valuation methodologies. \"There is an independent asset valuer and then there is a transaction advisor who will do the business valuation. Then, the value will be arrived at. But, this valuation or the reserve price will not be revealed unless the financial bids are received.\"Officers\\' unions of blue-chip public sector undertakings (PSUs) have opposed the government\\'s decision to privatise India\\'s second-biggest oil firm BPCL, saying family silver worth Rs9 lakh crore is being sold for a fraction of the amount.\"Our comprehensive evaluation of the assets of BPCL reveals true worth of BPCL to be  9 lakh crore. Today\\'s market cap of BPCL is  1.06 lakh crore,\" Mukul Kumar, convenor, Federation of Oil PSU Officers and Confederation of Maharatna Companies, have said.BPCL has a market capitalisation of about Rs1 lakh crore and the government stake at current prices is worth about Rs54,000 crore. The successful bidder will also have to make an open offer to other shareholders for acquiring another 26% at the same price.Privatisation of Air India and BPCL is essential for meeting the record Rs2.1 lakh crore target Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has set from disinvestment proceeds in the Budget for 2020-21.This is the second attempt for sale of Air India after the failed attempt in 2018. Losses notwithstanding, it has some lucrative assets that include prized slots at London\\'s choked Heathrow airport, a fleet of more than 100 planes and thousands of trained pilots and crew.BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai, Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15% of India\\'s total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes. While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country.

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Flights carrying patients needing urgent medical attention began from the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, a long-sought confidence-building measure in diplomatic efforts to end the five-year war. Fifteen-year-old Abdallah Abed was one of 16 patients to be flown out on the first flight to Amman. I have kidney failure and I need a transplant, he said. God willing we travel today to Jordan for treatment.  The flights took two years of negotiations to set up, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Yemen Lise Grande said from Sanaa airport, which has been closed to civilian flights since 2015. There are thousands of patients who need this care. This is the first flight, there will be more, she said, adding that the real solution is to end the war.   Supervised by the United Nations and World Health Organization, flights from Sanaa will go to Amman and Cairo. WHO said the majority of the patients are women and children suffering cancer and brain tumors, or needing organ transplants and reconstructive surgeries. It is hoped these flights will enable the opening of regular medical bridge flights for sick patients, said aid organization the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). There is no justification for punishing very sick civilians by blocking them from accessing medical treatment.  Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from Sanaa in late 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore Hadi. Although the Houthis control Sanaa airport, access is restricted by the coalition, which controls the air space. The airport has been closed to civilian flights since 2015 although  U.N. planes have been permitted to land there. Re-opening the airport has been a major aim of U.N.-led peace talks and a key demand of the Houthi administration.    The medical flights were the result of months of negotiations and the project had received an extraordinary amount of diplomatic support, U.N. Yemen Envoy Martin Griffiths said in an address to the Security Council last month.  The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations to end the war. Separately, Riyadh has been holding informal talks with the Houthis since late September about de-escalation. Griffiths held last-minute talks with Houthi authorities on Sunday regarding the medical evacuation plans, a diplomatic source said, adding that about 60 patients and relatives are expected to leave on flights this week.  Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the Houthis Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said 32,000 people are registered on medical evacuation lists.

       " 'NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwans Wistron Corp plans to assemble printed circuit boards (PCBs) for iPhones at its new plant in southern India, two sources said, highlighting Apple Incs push to expand manufacturing in the worlds second-biggest smartphone market. The local assembly of PCBs by Wistrons India unit will be a first for the contract manufacturer, which began making Apples low-priced SE model in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru in 2017. It currently assembles the 6S and 7 iPhone models there as well. A PCB is a bed for key components such as processors, memory and wireless chip sets that are the heart of an electronic device. Once assembled, or populated with components, PCBs account for about half the cost of a smartphone. Wistrons second iPhone plant, some 65 km (40 miles) from Bengaluru, is expected to become operational by April, the sources said, adding that it will make iPhone 7 and 8 models, some of which will be exported. The facility will be capable of producing up to 8 million smartphones annually, they said. The plan is part of Wistrons 30 billion rupee ($422.12 million) investment proposal submitted to the Karnataka state government in 2018. Wistrons bigger rival Foxconn, which began making iPhone XR models in India last year, already assembles PCBs for those devices locally. The deepening of PCB assembly in India will help Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple save on import taxes on smartphone components, levied by Prime Minister Narendra Modis government to boost local manufacturing and create new jobs. On Saturday, India said in its federal budget that it will from April begin taxing imports of populated PCBs at a higher 20%, from the previous rate of 10%. Apple declined to comment. Wistron did not respond to a request for comment.  Apple, which still makes most of its iPhones in China, has gradually moved to expand production in other countries as Washington and Beijing wage a disruptive battle over trade and technology. In India, a market with 1.1 billion wireless connections and about 480 million smartphones, Apples premium devices have proven too costly for many consumers. The companys market share by shipment volumes is just over 1%, though it was among the fastest growing smartphone brands in India in the quarter to Dec. 2019, according to market researcher Counterpoint. India remains largely dependent on China for supplies of smartphone parts such as cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards. The coronavirus outbreak in China could cause a delay in Wistron and Apples plans for India, one of the sources said.  The epidemic, which has killed more than 250 so far, threatens to disrupt Indias production of smartphones if it continues to spread, Reuters reported previously.

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing on Monday accused the United States of spreading fear over a coronavirus outbreak by pulling nationals out and restricting travel instead of offering significant aid. The United States was the first nation to begin evacuations, issued a travel warning against going to China, and from Sunday barred entry to foreigners recently in China.  Washington has unceasingly manufactured and spread panic, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised against trade and travel curbs. It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations, she added, saying countries should make reasonable, calm and science-based judgements. In China, 361 people have died with more than 17,000 infected from the virus, which originated in the central city of Wuhan. At least another 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, from the United States to Japan.  Conducting her daily news briefing via the WeChat app rather than in person, Hua also chided the United States for lack of help. So far, the U.S. government has yet to provide any substantial assistance to China, she said. That contrasted with President Donald Trumps weekend comments that U.S. officials had offered tremendous help.  However, his national security adviser Robert OBrien told an interviewer China had not yet accepted U.S. offers of aid. Tensions over the coronavirus come after the two worlds largest economies have only just started to patch up relations from an 18-month trade war. Trump said over the weekend the United States had shut down the coronavirus threat. We cant have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, he told broadcaster Fox. Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam have also announced restrictions on travel from China, while numerous nations have been evacuating citizens.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would act to stop the early release from prison of convicted terrorists following a street attack by an Islamist militant days after he was set free half way through his jail term. Sudesh Amman, jailed in 2018 for possession of terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications, was shot dead by police on Sunday after he stabbed two people with a 10-inch (25-cm) knife in a rampage on a busy London street.  Amman, 20, had previously praised the Islamic State group, shared an online al Qaeda magazine and encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents. Johnson said he had come to the end of my patience with the freeing of offenders before they had completed their sentences and without any scrutiny.  We do think its time to take action to ensure that people - irrespective of the law that were bringing in - people in the current stream do not qualify automatically for early release, Johnson said in a speech. The government had already promised tougher rules on terrorism since another former convict killed two people and wounded three more before police shot him dead near London Bridge in November. Justice minister Robert Buckland said that following Sundays attack, emergency legislation would be introduced to make immediate changes in dealing with people convicted of terrorism offences. Offenders will no longer be released early automatically and any release before the end of their sentence will be dependent on the risk assessment of the parole board, he told parliament, adding the change would apply to serving prisoners. Johnson said efforts to deradicalize and rehabilitate militants have had little success. Amman had been released from prison on Jan. 23, according to police, having been jailed for promoting violent Islamist material. On Sunday afternoon, he stole a knife from a shop and went on the rampage with a fake bomb strapped to his body. In an attack that lasted around 60 seconds, he stabbed two people, while a third suffered minor injuries caused by shattered glass when police opened fire. Amman was under surveillance at the time by armed police. Two of the three injured have been dishcharged from hospital and the third was in a serious but stable condition, police said on Monday. In November 2018 Amman pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and the following month he was sentenced to more than three years in prison. His mother, Haleema Faraz Khan, told Sky News he was a nice, polite boy who was radicalized online and in prison. She said she had spoken to her son hours before the attack, and he had seemed normal when she saw him days before.  Britain has about 220 people in prison with terrorism convictions. In 2016, Britain announced plans to isolate radical Islamists in high security jails to limit their ability to influence other inmates amid concerns that prisons were breeding grounds for extremists. Ian Acheson, who carried out a review of the management of Islamist extremists in jail, said the prison service did not have the aptitude to manage terrorist offenders.   We may need to accept there are certain people who are so dangerous they must be kept in prison indefinitely, he told BBC radio. Mark Rowley, formerly Britains senior counter-terrorism police officer, said dozens of other people convicted of terrorism offences were due to be released early under the  sentencing guidelines. We have an issue about if you have about 200 or so inside, the question is how do you detain them? Johnson said.  Do you detain them en bloc as it were in one group and try and keep them together because that avoids them infecting or passing the virus of their beliefs to others in jails. Or do you disperse and try to stop them reinfecting each other?  Amman was 17 and living at home with his family when he first began committing terrorism offences, according to authorities. Police said he had downloaded material about making explosives and carrying out terrorist attacks. Messages showed that he had discussed with his family, friends and girlfriend his extreme views and desire to carry out an attack, often focused on using a knife, prosecutors said. In one, he encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents. Islamic State claimed responsibility for Sundays attack although police said it was an isolated incident.

But Aam Aadmi Party and Congress are playing the game of politics. By keeping Constitution and tricolour in the foreground, attention being diverted from real conspiracy, he said.Taking a swipe at Congress, the PM said those who questioned Batla House encounter are saving those who raised tukde tukde slogan.The protest at Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi has been going on for more than 50 days, and is led by women. The protest has led to the closure of a key road (No 13A) which connects Delhi to Noida. The administration as well as locals have requested the protesters to clear the road so that the commuters dont face inconvenience, but they have ignored all the requests.The protesters want the government to take back the amendments to the citizenship law, which fast-tracks citizenship to persecuted minorities from three neighbouring countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The protesters say that the law divides the society on the basis of religion - a charge vehemently denied by the government.

       " 'Novak Djokovic does not believe he crossed the line touching the chair umpire during a volatile Australian Open final on Sunday night. The Serb is facing the prospect of a hefty fine for twice tapping Damien Dumusois on the foot while remonstrating with the French official during his drama-charged five-set win over Dominic Thiem.The Serbian lost his cool when he was handed back-to-back time violations in the one game for taking too long to serve. With the score locked at 4-4 in the second set, the second penalty came at break point and cost him a first serve, with Djokovic losing the game.A furious Djokovic marched past the umpires chair and tapped Dumusoiss foot and sarcastically exclaimed: You made yourself famous in this match. Great job. Especially in the second one. Great job. You made yourself famous. Well done, man.Dumusois did not react. But, according to the official grand slam rule book, Djokovic could find himself hit with a $US20,000 ($A30,000) fine, although penalties are discretionary.The rules state: Players shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site. Violation of this section shall subject a player to a fine up to $US20,000 for each violation.But Djokovic does not believe he overstepped the mark. For touching his shoe? I mean, I didnt know thats completely forbidden, he said after capturing his eighth Open crown.I thought it was a nice, really friendly touch. I wasnt aggressive with him in terms of physical abuse. I just couldnt believe that I got the time violation. It kind of disturbed me. Thats all there is to it.Verbally we did have some exchanges, but no insults because if I did insult him, I would get a warning. Right now that you tell me that, I want to thank him for not giving me a warning for touching him. Thats all I can say.Djokovic maintains the second violation was not necessary. The first one, fine, no problem, he said. The second one, its just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire.I thought probably he, in my opinion, could have reacted a little bit better in that situation. These kind of things in games switch the momentum of the match. It was a very important game.Obviously four-all, I broke his serve back, got myself back in the second set, then lost that game. He won the second set. That completely changed the momentum of the match.En route to his 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory, Djokovic also took issue with the Rod Laver Arena crowd getting behind underdog Thiem, who had never won a grand slam.Despite leading, Djokovic took aim at the fans during the first set when he felt his serves were interrupted by crowd.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - The man shot dead by police after wounding two people in a stabbing spree on a busy London street had been jailed for promoting violent Islamist material and had encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents. He had also once written a list of goals in life which included the desire to die as a martyr.  Police have named Sudesh Amman, 20, as the attacker. He was  killed on a street in the south London district of Streatham on Sunday afternoon by armed officers who had been carrying out surveillance on him. In November 2018, Amman had pleaded guilty to 13 offences of possession of terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications and the following month he was sentenced to more than three years in prison. He was released last month having served half the sentence. Amman was 17 and living at home in Harrow, north London, with his mother and four younger siblings when he first began committing terrorism offences, according to authorities. Police became aware of his activities in April 2018 and he was arrested in a north London street a month later. When officers examined his computers and phone, they found he had downloaded material about making explosives and carrying out terrorist attacks, court documents show. Amongst the material found were documents titled How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom and U.S. Army Knife Fighting Manual techniques and Bloody Brazilian Knife Fightin Techniques. Messages showed that he had discussed with his family, friends and girlfriend his extreme views and desire to carry out an attack, often focused on using a knife. In online chat you tell your girlfriend that you have declared a pledge to Islamic State and that you wish to purge society and carry out acid attacks, Judge Mark Lucraft said when he sentenced him to prison.  You speak about preferring a knife attack to the use of bombs and ask about having a knife delivered to her address.  In December 2017 Amman posted a picture of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed during a U.S. raid in Syria in October.  He also described Yazidi women as slaves and said the Koran made it permissible to rape them. In another message he encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents. Police said he had shared an online al-Qaeda magazine with his family and while in a discussion about school with a sibling he wrote he would rather blow myself up. Ammans mother told Sky News her son was a nice, polite boy who had been radacalized by watching extremists Islamist material online and became more religious while in prison. She said she had spoken to him just hours before the attack to say he wanted some of her mutton biryani and when she last saw him days earlier he had appeared normal. He was fine when I went to see him, she told Sky. He became more religious inside prison, thats where I think he became radicalized. He was watching and listening to things online which brainwashed him. Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Angus MacSwan',\n",

A 2015 study from Stanford University in California found that productivity among call-center employees at Chinese travel agency Ctrip went up by 13% when they worked from home due to fewer breaks and more comfortable work environments.Shared SpacesWhile the virus may test that theory on a wider scale, it poses an existential threat to another new business model: co-working spaces, which multiplied around big Chinese cities in recent years as property rents skyrocketed and tech startups boomed.It will be a very tough time,\" said Dave Tai, deputy director of Beeplus, a Chinese co-working space and bakery with 300 employees.The virus delayed the opening of its Beijing location and he says its pretty much impossible for him and others in his industry to work from home. Without customers willing to work in close quarters at the physical space, the business will die.The core of work space is community, people coming together. Its difficult to replace that interaction and connection online,\" he said.For many companies, instructing office workers to stay home only solves part of the problem. Many rely on factories, logistics companies and retail outlets that face their own disruptions.For phone-case maker Casetify, 2020 was supposed to be the best year yet. Headcount at the Hong Kong-based company had surpassed 150 by the end of December, and it was aiming to double sales this year.But the spread of the virus from the city of Wuhan caused the factories in China that make its products to stay shut and prompted Casetify to ask most employees to work from home. A new outlet in Hong Kongs airport lay empty. Sales in the city tanked.The show must go on, somehow,\" said Casetify Chief Executive Officer Wes Ng, who has been logging onto a laptop in an apartment he shares with his wife and 9-month-old son.No Plan BCasetify has 30 days of extra stock, but Ng says theres no plan B if the factories dont reopen soon, a plight shared by thousands of other businesses in China and around the world.Even for those who can do business by internet and phone, the virus means there may not be much business to do.Bankers say IPOs and deals are on hold. Transaction value in the first 30 days of 2020 was half what it was the year before, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The worst is yet to come,\" said Nomura analyst Ting Lu in a research note. We reckon the coronavirus could deal a more severe blow to Chinas economy in the near term, relative to SARS in 2003.\"While statistics suggest the new coronavirus isnt as lethal as SARS, it has already infected more people, and the speed at which the disease has spread is fueling fear. A big part of the expected blow to the economy during the current outbreak is likely to come from changes in human psychology,\" according to Warwick McKibbon, professor of economics at the Australian National University in Canberra.He said SARS cost the global economy $40 billion and predicts the hit from coronavirus will reach three or four times that amount. Panic is what seems to be the biggest drain on the economy, rather than deaths,\" he said.With factories shuttered and office workers staying home, many in Chinas services industry face a difficult time. The sector is much bigger than it was during the SARS outbreak, accounting for 53% of the economy, up from 41% in 2002. But without customers, many businesses are in limbo.Blockbuster movie premieres, most of which were slated for the new year holiday, have been postponed, Nomura said.Some businesses have turned to the internet to help keep customers loyal, hoping to weather the epidemic.Not Working OutShanghai gym owner Fenix Chen had intended to close his gym Hi Funny for three days for the Spring festival. He delayed reopening until Feb. 10, in line with the citys recommendation.Most people in Shanghai are basically staying at home, avoiding public places,\" he said. The fear from the virus outbreak will have a lasting impact on our business.\"So Chen is encouraging clients to exercise at home and posting instructional videos online.

Im saying I kind of liked our more but obviously this is a completely different movie. And I dont think its perhaps right to compare but, of course, the producers have chosen the same name and I am quite possessive over our film. I dont want to come across the wrong way because of course what I said was a joke.

Both films have been helmed by Imtiaz Ali.Also read: Deepika Padukone celebrates sister Anishas birthday, attends 25th anniversary bash of dad Prakashs badminton academyAccording to Saif, Love Aaj Kal will find relevance in every generation, because it revolves around the ever-evolving language of love. I do understand that the idea behind the film is that when the minute the language of love kind of changes, one can make this film with every generation. So Im sure its a completely different film from ours. And all the best guys, just a joke, he said.Saif also opened up about the much-talked-about chemistry between Sara and Kartik and called it interesting. He also said that it was one of the major draws of Love Aaj Kal.I think it is very interesting. Both of them are tremendously popular actors. Im sure you know people are going to flock to see the movie, he said.Earlier, at the trailer launch of Love Aaj Kal, Sara said that their film was not a sequel, but a fresh take on how love has changed over the years. She said that comparisons were inevitable and the team of the 2009 film did a fantastic job portraying what love was, back then. However, she added that their Love Aaj Kal was a different story with new characters.Follow @htshowbiz for more',\n",

Making a healthy comparison with Jayalalithaa, the Panga actor pointed out how they hold different statuses in the film fraternity. She (Jayalalithaa) was not like me. She was a more glamorous star ... Somebody like an Aishwarya Rai in Bollywood. It was a very big challenge to fit into those shoes because Im not known as a glamorous star, Kangana said.Explaining the common thread that led them to unusual actors, she continued: She was a very reluctant actor. It is the same with me. I never wanted to be an actor, and that is why we became very unusual actors.Talking about how both of them took up parallel professions along with acting, she further said: I think she always felt that she was worth much more than just being a glam doll [in films], and she became a politician. Like how I became a filmmaker because I felt that being an actress was very limiting for me. So, I think there are parallels.The Padma Shri awardee also highlighted about the times in her life where she longed for a family and also expressed how this aspect of her life was similar to Jayalalitha. I think, like every woman, she longed for a family, and she longed for a child. There was a time in my life also when I longed for a family. Some of the married people took advantage of that ...

       " 'Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has said that he will not allow the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to be implemented in the state but also defended the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) saying it is not about taking away citizenship rights from anyone. Thackerays backing of the Citizenship Act may create issues in the coalition government of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress in Maharashtra. The Congress and NCP  Senas new alliance partners  have already opposed the amendment.In a short video clip of an interview with Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray said the amendment in the Citizenship Act is not about taking away citizenship. CAA is not a law to remove anybody from the country, Thackeray is seen responding in the teaser video clip of the interview conducted by Sena leader and Saamana editor Sanjay Raut.Thackeray has also sought to assuage concerns of Muslims over the implementation of NRC. The chief minister said that proving citizenship will be difficult for both Hindus and Muslims. Thackeray said, Proving citizenship will be difficult for both Hindus and Muslims. I will not let that happen.The Shiv Sena had backed the Citizenship Amendment Bill when it was tabled in the Lok Sabha in December 2019. However, after the Congress leadership expressed unhappiness over Senas stance, the party did not back the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Sena MPs, including Raut, walked out ahead of the voting on the Bill in the upper house. Subsequently, the Sena mouthpiece had slammed the Narendra Modi-government on the CAA and NRC stating that it had led to countywide protests.In the video, Raut also asked Thackeray if he is firm on his stand to remove illegal Pakistanis and Bangladeshis immigrants. Though it has been Shiv Senas stance since the time of Bal Thackeray to throw out illegal Bangladeshis and Pakistanis in Mumbai and Maharashtra, the issue has now been taken up by Uddhavs estranged cousin and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, who has adopted a hardline Hindutva stance.Political observers pointed out that Thackeray continues to play the Senas Hindutva card while managing to keep the secular allies happy in Maharashtra.

       " 'MUMBAI : Economists at domestic rating agency Crisil doubt the budget attaining its targets on growth, given the rural boost and thus consumption and revenue realisations, saying planned budgetary measures are not expected to provide a short-term boost.Noting that the economy is facing its worst slowdown in over a decade, a Crisil report has said this was because consumption and investment have stopped firing for too long.If at all the GDP were to clip at the projected 5.7-6.6 percent in FY21, it will be thanks more to the base effect-FY20 growth at an 11-year low of 5 percent, down from 6.1 percent in FY19 on the back of a 48 year low nominal growth of at 7.5 percent in FY20.\"The given its tied hands, the government has aimed at some measured moves in the budget to bolster growth. Most of these, however, are not expected to provide a short-term boost,\" says the Crisil report.\"In the absence of growth kickers, growth pick-up in fiscal 2021 is expected to be largely led by the base effect and supported by somewhat better farm income (led by a good rabi crop) and the delayed impact of monetary easing. Critical to this forecast is the assumption of a normal monsoon in the next season and benign global crude oil prices,\" it warns.\"If that sounds bad, the financial sector stress has been looping into real sector weakness, dragging down growth some more. The external front has also landed the domestic economy a few blows. What makes this \"shrinking\" feeling stranger and last longer is the long-overdue financial sector clean-up, at a time when the economy is suffering from many other ailments.\"To be sure, monetary policy has done its bit, but with moderate and slow success. The Reserve Bank cut the repo rate cumulatively by 135 basis points through calendar 2019, but lending rates has tarried with just 50-bps decline,\" the report notes.The additional fiscal space of 50 bps more over FY20 budget estimate projection for FY21 (fiscal deficit projected at 3.5 percent of GDP next fiscal against the glide path of 3 percent) is to be funded by aggressive disinvestment, asset monetisation and telecom revenues, optimistic tax-buoyancy assumptions and some tightening in overall expenditure. But the space so created is being used to fund capex and rural sector spending that support consumption, it says.It can be noted that this is the fourth consecutive budget that the Modi government has missed the original budget estimates on deficit numbers.Despite tight fiscal conditions, the budget makes room for higher capex. Overall capex is budgeted to increase 18 per cent in fiscal 2021. A large part of this is infra spending. But ironically, the overall infrastructure spending is budgeted to decline 7 per cent in FY21 because of lower reliance on extra budgetary spending through central public sector units despite higher budgetary support.Similar is the projected slowdown revenue expenditure in fiscal 2021, led by lower burden of food, fuel and fertiliser subsidies.

Dubbed as iPhone 9 aka iPhone SE 2, the phone has already entered the trial production. Apple has finally started trial production of the highly anticipated iPhone 9.

Those committed to long-term savings and investing via 80C may be discouraged and this may likely de-motivate them from investing in tax-saving asset classes,\" said Archit Gupta, founder of Cleartax.Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw tweeted that removal of exemptions and DDT will hurt individual tax payer and affect consumer spending.Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking said the widely expected personal income tax cuts have come in with lots of caveats, leaving no major impacts.The government on Saturday introduced new tax slabs with reduced rates for an annual income of up to  15 lakh for those foregoing exemptions and deductions under a simplified tax regime.The new income tax system is optional and a taxpayer can choose to remain in the existing regime with exemptions and deductions.It is to be noted that once the option to opt for new tax regime is exercised, it will remain valid for subsequent years.\"In order to provide significant relief to the individual taxpayers and to simplify the Income-Tax law, I propose to bring a new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions,\" Sitharaman said in her Budget Speech.Under the new tax proposal, people with an annual income of up to  2.5 lakh will not have to pay any tax.For income between  2.5 lakh to 5 lakh, the tax rate (as earlier) is 5 per cent.Further, those with an income of  5 lakh to  7.5 lakh will have to pay a reduced tax rate of 10 per cent; between  7.5 lakh and  10 lakh 15 per cent; between  10 lakh and 12.5 lakh 20 per cent; between  12.5 lakh and 15 lakh 25 per cent; and above  15 lakh 30 per cent.\"The new tax regime shall be optional for the taxpayers. An individual who is currently availing more deductions and exemption under the Income Tax Act may choose to avail them and continue to pay tax in the old regime,\" the minister had said.The proposal would lead to a revenue sacrifice of  40,000 crore per annum.

       " 'On the morning of December 26, Wuhan-based respiratory expert, Zhang Jixian, 54, diagnosed four people including three from the same family with a new kind of flu.They had one thing in common  on x-ray, their lungs appeared similarly distressed with pneumonia.Next day, three more patients came to her with the same symptoms.Zhang Jixian was alerted.What particularly worried her was that members of the same family were getting the disease. It meant one thing  the disease was infectious.In general, there will only be one patient when a family visits a doctor, and three people will not get the same disease at the same time unless it is an infectious disease, she said.Four among the first seven patients of this new kind of pneumonia had one more thing in common  the Huanan seafood and meat market which also traded in wildlife.Unknown to her, Zhang had become the first doctor in the world to diagnose and then track the novel Coronavirus, which in the next five weeks would kill over 300 and affected more than 14,000 globally.A month later, Zhang is now a hero in China.On Sunday, the Wuhan-based Yangtze River Daily became one of the first media to interview her.Since Zhangs interview in Chinese went online on Sunday, it had been read 420 million times and 93000 threads of discussions on it were active on Chinas Twitter-like Weibo platforms. Zhang, described as mild mannered and gentle, is the director of the Respiratory and Critical Care department of the Hubei provincial hospital.This is a disease we have never seen before. There were also four patients from the south China seafood market. This was definitely a problem, Zhang recounted to the local daily about her first encounter with the deadly virus.She said in all seven patients, the symptoms in the lungs were consistent with only difference in severity. Zhang realised that the situation was abnormal, and immediately reported to the hospital, and suggested that the hospital hold a multi-department consultation.It has been verified that those seven cases of pneumonia were the very first cases of the novel Coronavirus.In the next few days, Zhangs hands were full.By New Years Day, these nine isolation beds (in the hospital) were not enough, Zhang said.Soon a team of experts from different hospitals in the city were coordinating their efforts to track the disease.Since the discovery of the first cases, Zhang directed all respiratory medical staff to wear masks. The hospital approved N95 professional protective masks for their department.We only wear N95 when we enter that area. Other areas are still general medical masks, she said.As early as December 31, doctors dealing with the new pneumonia were using protective and isolation clothes when treating the patients.Zhang said that the experience in protection against infectious diseases is rooted in SARS. When fighting SARS in 2003, when she was 37 years old, she was a member of the expert group in a local district. Her daily task was to go to various hospitals to investigate suspects.',\n",

He was also the subject of a live investigation.One man and two women were injured, according to initial reports, with police confirming that one was in a life-threatening condition. Scotland Yard said a second victim had minor injuries while a thirds condition was described as not life-threatening. All three were treated at the scene and then taken to hospital.While the investigation is at an early stage it is believed that the suspect was motivated by an Islamist terrorist ideology.The Metropolitan police confirmed the man, who was shot at about 2pm, had been pronounced dead and added that the scene had been fully contained.The man shot dead by police was wearing a fake suicide vest made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device. A similar vest was worn by attackers during the London Bridge attack in 2017 and the later London Bridge attack in November 2019.An earlier tweet from the force said: A man has been shot by armed officers in Streatham. At this stage it is believed a number of people have been stabbed. The circumstances are being assessed; the incident has been declared as terrorist-related.Witnesses on social media said they had heard three gunshots. It is not known how many people were stabbed. Images posted online show a person face down on the ground outside a Boots chemist.As footage emerged on social media of armed police approaching the prone figure on the pavement, police cordoned off the street and advised people to avoid the area. Some local residents were asked to leave their flats. Eyewitnesses said that the officers were in plain clothes.One witness said he had seen the shooting in front of a Boots store on Streatham High Road. I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer  as they were in civilian clothing, he told PA Media.The man was then shot. I think I heard three gunshots but I cant quite remember. After that I ran into the library to get to safety. From the library I saw a load of ambulances and armed police officers arrive on the scene.He said people began running into nearby stores after the incident. We were all informed to stay in buildings by armed police, until we were evacuated, he said.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said in a statement: A man has been shot dead by armed police in Streatham following an incident that is being treated as terrorism-related. A number of people are believed to have been stabbed.I am in close contact with the Met commissioner and local representatives, and want to thank our police, security and emergency services staff for their swift and courageous response. They truly are the best.Terrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life  here in London we were never let them succeed.Boris Johnson, the prime minister, responded to the incident on Twitter, saying: Thank you to all emergency services responding to the incident in Streatham, which the police have now declared as terrorism-related. My thoughts are with the injured and all those affected.The local Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, also responded, saying: Very concerned to hear about the incident on Streatham High St. My thoughts are with those injured, their families and those who witnessed the attack.Video footage posted by witnesses showed a huge police presence on Streatham High Road, as shoppers were held back by police officers. Paramedics and ambulances attended the scene, and police helicopters circled overhead.The Met warned people to stay away from the area, tweeting: Please avoid the area while the emergency services deal with the incident in Streatham.Graham Norton, the strategic commander at the London Ambulance Service, said: We were called at 1.58pm today to reports of an incident in Streatham High Road. We are working closely with the other emergency services and are treating a number of patients at the scene.We worked closely with the other emergency services and sent a number of resources including five ambulance crews, an advanced paramedic practitioner, an incident response officer and a motorcycle responder, with the first of our medics arriving in four minutes. We also dispatched Londons Air Ambulance.We treated three patients for injuries at the scene, and took all three people to hospital.Anna Norman-Walker, the rector of St Leonards Church in Streatham, tweeted: Currently situation in the Streatham rectory with police tape both sides of us  Prayers for our wonderful police who are doing such a remarkable job in a frightening situation.Richard Mustonen-Smith, 59, a response pastor for Ascension Trust, has lived in the area all his life. He told PA Media: Im shocked its happened in Streatham. Ive been here all my life. Were always getting accidents down here but not this.My grandson was in the Odeon and they got told to go out the back because there was a bomb. They got them to go out of the back of the cinema.When its a member of your family so close to you you dont expect it.

       " 'World Athletics on Friday announced a ban on using prototype shoes in competition after a recent spate of world records set by athletes wearing the Nike Vaporfly trainers. From April 30 2020, any shoe must have been available for purchase by any athlete on the open retail market (online or in store) for a period of four months before it can be used in competition, athletics governing body said in a statement. The basic Nike Vaporfly has a carbon blade in the sole, which stores and releases energy on each step, and air cushions.Kenyan marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge broke the two-hour mark for the distance in Vienna last October wearing a new Vaporfly prototype with three carbon blades in the sole and four air cushions.But that would be banned under the new rules which state that shoes cannot contain more than one rigid embedded plate or blade of any material, although shoes with spikes can have an additional plate for the purpose of attaching spikes to the sole.Kenyas Brigid Kosgei broke Paula Radcliffes womens marathon world record in Chicago with a time of 2hr 14min 04sec, wearing the basic one-blade version that has been available in shops since 2017.It is not our job to regulate the entire sports shoe market but it is our duty to preserve the integrity of elite competition by ensuring that the shoes worn by elite athletes in competition do not offer any unfair assistance or advantage, said World Athletics president Sebastian Coe.As we enter the Olympic year, we dont believe we can rule out shoes that have been generally available for a considerable period of time, but we can draw a line by prohibiting the use of shoes that go further than what is currently on the market while we investigate further.Kipchoge had defended claims he only managed to break two hours due to his footwear.I trained hard, he told British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. In Formula 1, Pirelli issues the tyres to all the cars but Mercedes are the best one. Why? Its the engine. Its the person.Its the person who is running, not the shoe.

       " 'Shardul Thakur, KL Rahul and even Virat Kohlis performance was highlighted in Indias second successive Super Over win against New Zealand inside three days in the Westpac Stadium in Wellington on Friday. The fast bowler for taking the match into the Super Over by picking up two wickets in the final over and Kohli and Rahul for their precised batting in chasing down the required 14 runs in 5 balls. But if it wasnt for Manish Pandey then probably would not have got to the 165-run total they put on board. Pandey scored his third T20I fifty and remained unbeaten to help India to 165 for 8 after they were reduced to 88 for 6 at one point. Pandey, who generally bats in the top-order for Karnataka and India A, has been batting at No.6 in this T20I series in New Zealand. On two of the 4 T20Is, all-rounder Shivam Dube was sent ahead of Pandey.Also Read | The one with most Tests: Ganguly on Indias next chief selectorI have no choice. I have to be good with it. I have to start preparing my mind as a no. 6 batsman because normally I bat up the order, no. 3 or no.4. Here with the competition up the top, you just have to wait for your chances, he said at a press conference after Indias Super Over win over New Zealand in the fourth T20I in Wellington.  Pandey, who scored an unbeaten 50 off 36 balls also stitcthed an important 47-run partnership with Shardul Thakur that bailed India out of trouble.Today was the opportunity and Ive been preparing myself as to how to bat at no. 6 and what kind of shots I can play, what kind of bowlers, and how many overs are left. Its not an easy position to bat at no. 6, where you know you are the last main batsman and you have to play with the bowlers if anything happens up the top. Thats what happened today. I was pretty clear about my role. Also Read | If Pant is a match-winner, why dont you play him:SehwagI just have to play those twos, look to rotate the strike. Ive been working on that and today I thought it came off really well. If you want to bat at six, then you have to be pre-ready. The game is already set for you at no. 6 and you just have to sometimes go and perform at the speed that the previous batsmen have set for you, Pandey said.This is the second time in a row in this series that New Zealand have collapsed in the final over after a comfortable run chase. While the hosts needed 10 to win off the last over in the previous T20I, in Wellington, they needed just seven and went on to lose four wickets. Pandey said that India will be looking to seal an unprecedented 5-0 series win in Mount Maunganui on Sunday. It has been our motto, not only for these two matches, that till the time the last ball is bowled, we wont give up any match. If you play with that intent you will get matches like these where you might get a Super Over, and you win from there, he said. And now we have an opportunity to make it 5-0 and it will be really amazing to do that. Come the fifth match, we will look to go 5-0 up, that is our plan. Nobody has done it before and especially India has not done it before. So, I think it will be a great start to do that.(With IANS inputs) ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - New Zealand announced on Sunday it would bar entry into the country from all foreign nationals arriving from mainland China due too the increasing threat from the coronavirus epidemic. The ban is in effect from Monday and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade also raised its travel advice to New Zealanders for all of mainland China to Do not travel, the highest level. We have been advised by health officials that while there are still a range of unknowns in the way the virus is being transmitted, we should take a precautionary approach, New Zealands Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement.  New Zealand citizens and permanent residents can still enter the country, as can their immediate family members, but will be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival back in the country. The ban will be in effect for up to 14 days, reviewed every 48 hours and includes all foreign travelers who left or transited through mainland China after February 2. There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Zealand. New Zealands announcement followed a similar decision announced on Saturday by neighboring Australia, where 12 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed. China is facing mounting isolation amid increasing international travel curbs and flight suspension Qantas Airways  and Air New Zealand  both said they were suspending direct flights to mainland China. Australia announced during the week that it would evacuate locals from the Chinese city of Wuhan as part of a joint operation with New Zealand. Some health officials have criticized Australias decision to move its evacuees to Christmas Island - about 1,500km (900 miles) from Australia, which had been used to hold thousands of refugees between 2002 and 2018. Australian Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Sunday he expected Australians to be airlifted from Wuhan soon and that a medical assessment team and mobile hospital was ready to greet them. Personnel are in place to receive the passengers from Wuhan and we expect that the flight will be collecting within the next 24 hours, Hunt said.

       " 'CAIRO (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority has cut all ties with the United States and Israel, including those relating to security, after rejecting a Middle East peace plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Saturday. Abbas was in Cairo to address the Arab League, which backed the Palestinians in their opposition to Trumps plan. The blueprint, endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for the creation of a demilitarised Palestinian state that excludes Jewish settlements built in occupied territory and is under near-total Israeli security control. Weve informed the Israeli side ... that there will be no relations at all with them and the United States including security ties, Abbas told the one-day emergency meeting, called to discuss Trumps plan. Israeli officials had no immediate comment on his remarks. Israel and the Palestinian Authoritys security forces have long cooperated in policing areas of the occupied West Bank that are under Palestinian control. The PA also has intelligence cooperation agreements with the CIA, which continued even after the Palestinians began boycotting the Trump administrations peace efforts in 2017. Abbas also said he had refused to discuss the plan by with Trump by phone, or to receive even a copy of it to study it. Trump asked that I speak to him by phone but I said no, and that he wants to send me a letter ... but I refused it, he said. Abbas said he did not want Trump to be able to say that he, Abbas, had been consulted. He reiterated his complete rejection of the Trump plan, presented on Tuesday. I will not have it recorded in my history that I sold Jerusalem, he said. The blueprint also proposes U.S. recognition of Israeli settlements on occupied West Bank land and of Jerusalem as Israels indivisible capital. The Arab League foreign ministers meeting in Cairo said the plan did not meet the minimum aspirations of Palestinians, and that the League would not cooperate with the United States in implementing it. The ministers affirmed Palestinian rights to create a future state based on the land captured and occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, with East Jerusalem as capital, the final communique said. Foreign ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, three close U.S. allies, as well as Iraq, Lebanon and others said there could be no peace without recognising Palestinian rights to establish a state within the pre-1967 territories. After Trump unveiled his plan, some Arab powers had appeared, despite historic support for the Palestinians, to prioritise close ties with the United States and a shared hostility towards Iran over traditional Arab alliances. Three Gulf Arab states - Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - attended the White House gathering where Trump announced his plan alongside Netanyahu. On Tuesday, Netanyahu said he would ask his cabinet this week to approve the application of Israeli law to Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Such a move could be a first step towards formal annexation of the settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in 1967. Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections.

       " 'A pensioner from Bristol has described his disbelief after Amazon delivered a 28kg (62lb) exercise machine he had not ordered, and then flatly refused to take it away  leaving it blocking his front room.Tony Harding, who is 79 and unable to move the heavy item, says Amazon effectively abandoned the giant box in his and his wifes Winterbourne home, apparently expecting him to dispose of the brand new exercise bike himself. Despite asking both the driver who brought the item, and a second driver who delivered the order he had been expecting, neither would take away the 149 machine. Customer services told him it was highly unlikely the company would come to retrieve the fitness bike, and he would have to dispose of it.Harding, who says he rarely uses Amazon because of concerns over its tax affairs, says he held his nose in January and ordered a 20kg bag of reconstituted logs.But he got more than he bargained for when the driver arrived with an enormous box, wrongly bearing his name and address.When I pointed out that the package contained a Nero Sports fitness bicycle, the delivery driver suggested that my logs might have been packed inside the box. I was flabbergasted by this suggestion, by which time the delivery man was halfway down the path. When I came to my senses I suggested to him that he should take the package back, or at least check that someone else in the Bristol area was due to receive a fitness bike. After checking his notes I was told he could not take the item back since he only did deliveries, Harding says.After finding his way through the maze of the Amazon website he says he eventually found a number to call where a very helpful person agreed to replace his missing logs. But when these arrived the second driver also refused to take the bike away.I was also told that if no one came to collect the fitness bike within 48 hours, I should feel free to dispose of it as I thought fit. That would be OK if had any use for an exercise bike, but I dont. Aside from the inconvenience of having it filling my front room, Im astonished at the cavalier waste of the worlds resources that have gone into this whole process. Im guessing that someone else has ordered this machine and they have been similarly sent a replacement, when they should have this one, he says.After Guardian Money stepped in, the response was swift  and the firm collected the package from Harding almost immediately, with a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates.A spokesman for Amazon said: We have contacted the customer to apologise for his experience and collect the bike. We have also investigated the matter with our delivery partner and are taking appropriate action.Environmental groups are increasingly questioning the role of tech firms and their lack of response to the climate emergency.Last August, Amazon was criticised by activists and customers after introducing a range of plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK. The online retailer had started sending small items in unrecyclable plastic envelopes, seemingly to allow more parcels to be loaded on to each delivery truck.In 2018, Money highlighted the extraordinary case of south London resident Tiffany Crow, who was being bombarded with hundreds of parcels from Amazon. Boxes of wireless speakers, fitness wristbands and batches of projectors kept arriving at her home, forcing her to spend hours dealing with them, and recycling all the packaging. Her repeated calls to Amazon to get them stopped drew a blank, and like Harding she was told she could do what she liked with them.In January, hundreds of Amazon employees in the US defied corporate policy to publicly criticise the company for failing to meet its moral responsibility in the face of the climate crisis.',\n",

The newly identified coronavirus, which is believed to have originated late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan, China, has created alarm because it spreads quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it. There are no confirmed cases in Mexico and all nine suspected cases were later declared negative.    Uber said in a statement posted on its Twitter account that two drivers may have transported a user who is possibly infected with the new coronavirus. It added the suspended users should contact health authorities if they develop symptoms.  For more detail on the nature of the virus please see FACTBOX  Like other respiratory infections, the virus spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. It has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and there are some limited signs it may also be able to spread before any symptoms show. It is still too early to know what its death rate will be, since there are likely to be many cases of milder disease going undetected. So far, it has been deadly in 259 cases.

       " \"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - At least 20 people were killed and more than a dozen hurt in a stampede as worshippers rushed to be anointed during a church service in northern Tanzania, officials said on Sunday. Thousands of people crammed into a sports stadium for the service on Saturday evening in the town of Moshi near Mount Kilimanjaro, with many getting crushed after the pastor called them to be anointed with blessed oil. The pastor was arrested later for his role in the incident as he sought to leave the country, officials said. Twenty people died and 16 others were injured in the incident, Moshi district commissioner Kippi Warioba told Reuters by telephone. Five of the dead were children, he said. The stampede occurred when the worshippers were rushing to get anointed with blessed oil, Warioba said. Pastor Boniface Mwamposa had been drawing huge crowds by promising prosperity and cures for diseases to worshippers who step in what he calls blessed oil during his services. He was arrested on Sunday in Tanzanias commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, as he attempted to flee the country, home affairs minister George Simbachawene said on Sunday. Mwamposa tried to flee after this incident, but we arrested him in Dar es Salaam ... he will be held accountable for causing this tragedy, the minister said. According to the minister, the stampede took place after the pastor instructed worshippers, who numbered some 10,000, to rush to one side of the stadium all at once to get anointed. Authorities fear the death toll could rise due to the size of the crowd and poor lighting when the stampede occurred. The incident took place at night and there were many people, so there is a possibility that more casualties could emerge. We are still assessing the situation, Warioba said. Tanzania has seen a rise in the number of prosperity gospel pastors in recent years, who promise to lift people out of poverty and perform what they call miracle cures. Thousands of people in the nation of 55 million flock to Pentecostal churches, whose main source of income is tithe, the 10% or so of income that worshippers are asked to contribute.

       " 'The Morrison government has backtracked on a contentious plan to charge people $1,000 for their evacuation from China to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, while Peter Dutton has departed from the government script by urging Australians planning an overseas holiday to stay home instead.With senior government figures on Sunday warning the pandemic will, alongside the drought and the bushfires, create a significant hit on the Australian economy, the home affairs minister urged Australians to spend their money at home.We need Australians, frankly, if they are considering a holiday at the moment, to reconsider whether an outbound overseas trip is what they want to do, Dutton told Sky News. If theyve thought about seeing parts of Australia, now might be a good time to book that holiday.The governments official travel advice, thus far, covers travel to and from China, which is the epicentre of the virus. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, told reporters later in the morning he wasnt part of any discussion with Dutton before his remarks, but I think its always sensible when youre planning to travel to consider the health advisories at the time.But at the moment, the medical advice is principally around China.As well as departing from the official travel advice, Dutton also appeared unaware during his interview on Sunday morning that the government had dumped the plan to charge people for their evacuations to Christmas Island. He said cost recovery was common sense and he noted most people will have paid much more than that for a return commercial flight.The health minister Greg Hunt later told reporters the mix up happened because the point was that the treasurer was announcing it this morning.The government late on Saturday implemented significant border control measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus. Scott Morrison announced that foreign arrivals from mainland China will not be allowed entry into Australia. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family, legal guardians and spouses will be excepted from the strict measure.While the government advised last week it would apply cost recovery to looming evacuations from China, Josh Frydenberg said on Sunday that would no longer be the case. He blamed the about face on the foreign affairs department, which he said had given the government incorrect information about past practices.The government had said previous governments had charged for airlifts such as those run out of Lebanon in 2006, and Egypt in 2011. But this was fiercely contested.Former prime minister Kevin Rudd, foreign minister at the time of the Arab Spring and the Egyptian evacuation, said online: Morrisons claim that Labor charged Australians for tickets on charter flights out of Egypt during the 2011 uprising is an outright falsehood.The cost (about $3400 per person) was borne by the government. Why is Scotty from Marketing slugging Aussies to get them out of Wuhan?The prime minister Julia Gillard said in a media release the charter will be provided free of charge, and the then head of the department of foreign affairs and trade, Dennis Richardson, confirmed at Senate estimates the costs of the charter were all borne by the government.Frydenberg said the government was still working with the Chinese government to determine when the first plane removing people to quarantine in Christmas Island would proceed. We hope that approval is imminent, the treasurer said.Frydenberg was asked on the ABC on Sunday whether the various hits on the economy could result in a negative quarter of growth, given growth was already weak before the disasters of the summer.The treasurer said he did not intend to speculate. He noted the economy had been resilient to date, but there were now many factors beyond the governments control.There are things that we can control and things that we cant control, he said. When it comes to the outbreak of the virus, when it comes to the fires, when it comes to the floods, when it comes to the trade tensions between the United States and China  we cant control those factors  but it does underline the importance of our disciplined economic management.Frydenberg refused to say whether he would, in the circumstances, be able to deliver a budget surplus, despite declaring definitively last year that the budget was back in the black.He said the governments primary focus was not on the number, but on delivering the support to the Australians who need it.Asked whether he got a bit carried away in the lead-up to the election in declaring repeatedly the budget is back in the black, when the government had not yet delivered a surplus, and the economy was exposed to a number of external shocks, Frydenberg said the government had delivered a balanced budget, and thats a significant achievement.In terms of a surplus, youll have to tune in on budget night, he said. What we do know is that these events outside of our control are going to have a significant impact on the Australian economy.With economic growth now imperilled because of the calamities of the summer, Dutton told Sky News the government was looking at measures to help the tourism sector, which has been hit by people staying away in the peak holiday seasons because of the bushfires, and now the impact of the virus. The government will have more to say in due course, he said.There is no question this will have an impact on the economy, but the first priority for the government at this point is the health and wellbeing of Australians, Dutton said.',\n",

The Congress will bring the Jan Lokpal Bill once elected to power, said Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra.\"Every girl in Delhi who wants to achieve higher education will receive it under the Ladli Yojana,\" he added.\"Pollution is a big concern for residents of New Delhi and Arvind Kejriwal did nothing for it,\" said Chopra, adding that the party will spend 25 per cent of the budget to tackle pollution. Noting that former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit started a pension scheme, the party said that if it comes to power, it will start the scheme under Dikshits name under which dependent parents will receive Rs 10,000 per month.Attacking the AAP, the Congress said that under the able leadership of Sheila Dikshit, Delhi was transformed into a progressive city but due to corruption and lies, Delhis development took a serious hit.With a strongfocus on the youths, the Congress will start the \\'Yuva Swabhiman Yojana\\' - an unemployment allowance for graduate youths at Rs 5,000 per month, and for postgraduate youths at Rs 7,500 per month.Other programmesfor the youth will be \\'Yaari Startup Incubation Fund\\' - a Rs 5,000 crore corpus to incentivise young entrepreneurs to open start-ups apart from investment of Rs 1,000 crore per year in start-ups for five years.The party will bring back non-polluting industries to create employment with industrial power tariff rate capped at Rs six/unit.For the citizens, the Congress has said it will demand the Centre to drop the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).As per the manifesto, under Paani Bachao, Paisa Kamao, the citizens will get cashback on water usage of fewer than 20,000 litres.Also, houses which save electricity will get cash rebate under Bijli Bachao, Paisa Kamao scheme.For women, the Congress will provide free education to girls in government schools and colleges, from Nursery to PhD.

       " 'Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, has unveiled a new approach to political advertising which he described as a stand for the principles of free speech, but also one that will piss off a lot of people.In a candid discussion at the Silicon Slopes Tech Summit 2020 in Salt Lake City on Friday, Zuckerberg said that since his company is criticized for both what it does and does not do in terms of monitoring use of its platform, it will now support free speech because in order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for.Were going to stand up for free expression, he said, apparently referring to the companys decision to resist pressure to ban political ads because it would be too tough to determine the line between true and false content.Its unfortunate that this is such a controversial thing, Zuckerberg said, adding that critics of his stance are typically people not at risk of being censored themselves.He did acknowledge that the Cambridge Analytica data breach might have been avoided with better monitoring of how customer data was being handled, and said the company was introducing tools to combat hate speech and terrorist recruiting.The issue of targeted political advertising, including its use in Russian interference with the 2016 US election, continues to haunt the social media giant.Facebook was recently accused of accepting a Trump ad that included false information about potential challenger Joe Biden and an Elizabeth Warren ad that contained false information. The Massachusetts senator said her campaign intentionally made the ad and submitted it to see if it would be approved.Zuckerberg has said he has considered banning political ads because from a business perspective the controversy is not worth the very small part of the business that they make up. But he has also said he believes that when its not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression.During a call with analysts last week, after Facebook announced a 27% rise in revenue for 2019 and record profits of $7.35bn for the final quarter, Zuckerberg said his goal for this next decade isnt to be liked, but to be understood.In Utah on Friday, he offered further explanation for the decision to refuse to ban political advertising, a step Twitter has taken.Powerful people are always going to have a voice, Zuckerberg said. I feel like someone needs to stand up for giving everyone a voice.His comments are unlikely to dampen pressure on his company, which has almost 1.6bn daily users, to take a more proactive role in editing content for inaccuracies and preventing the misappropriation of data.In a column for the New York Times on Friday, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros warned that Zuckerberg and Facebook would help Donald Trump win re-election in 2020, thanks to a developing informal mutual assistance operation or agreement.Soros wrote: I believe that Mr Trump and Facebooks chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, realise that their interests are aligned  the presidents in winning elections, Mr Zuckerbergs in making money.Facebook, Soros added, follow[s] only one guiding principle: maximise profits irrespective of the consequences.In Utah, Zuckerberg acknowledged that communication is not my best thing but said Facebook was ultimately about creating a place where everyone can participate.This is the new approach, and I think its going to piss off a lot of people, he said. But frankly the old approach was pissing off a lot of people too, so lets try something different.',\n",

       " 'The fifth series of Netflixs The Crown will be its last, its creator and writer, Peter Morgan, has revealed, as Imelda Staunton is confirmed to replace Olivia Colman as the Queen.Fans of the critically acclaimed show, watched by more than 73m households worldwide, had hoped for a sixth series, which Morgan himself had originally planned. But, he said he believed it was time to stop.Morgan said: Im absolutely thrilled to confirm Imelda Staunton as Her Majesty the Queen for the fifth and final season, taking The Crown into the 21st century. Imelda is an astonishing talent and will be a fantastic successor to Claire Foy and Olivia Colman.At the outset I had imagined The Crown running for six seasons but now that we have begun work on the stories for season five it has become clear to me that this is the perfect time and place to stop. Im grateful to Netflix and Sony for supporting me in this decision.Although the show was critically acclaimed in its first two series and won further awards for its third, some of the initial buzz around the programme appeared to have diminished. A list Netflix published of its most-watched shows of the year in the UK, including The Umbrella Academy and After Life, did not feature The Crown.Netflix said that 21m households had chosen to start watching the new season of the show in its first month, up 40% from Season 2. That figure includes anyone who watches the first two minutes of any episode. After a recent change the company no longer counts viewers over a longer period.Some also viewed the coincidence of the launch of the new series with Prince Andrews disastrous Newsnight interview as unfortunate timing for the show, with the Guardian columnist Emma Brockes writing: Its not often one has ones delusions dismantled in real time, but so it has been, this past fortnight, witnessing Prince Andrews flagrant awfulness in tandem with The Crowns terrible third season. The experience has been like a sudden, dramatic return to reason.Curtailing the series after season five means the show is unlikely to tackle contemporary problems faced by the royal family, including the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs decision to step down from royal duties, and the Duke of Yorks friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Colman made her debut as the Queen in season three, which covers the period between 1964 and 1977, replacing Foy. She reprises the role for season four, which is in production at Elstree Studios and other locations around the UK. Tobias Menzies and Helena Bonham Carter play Prince Philip and Princess Margaret in season three.Staunton, 64, said: I have loved watching The Crown from the very start. As an actor it was a joy to see how both Claire Foy and Olivia Colman brought something special and unique to Peter Morgans scripts. I am genuinely honoured to be joining such an exceptional creative team and to be taking The Crown to its conclusion.Staunton received a best actress nomination for her lead role in the 2004 drama Vera Drake, and is also known for playing Dolores Umbridge in the Harry Potter films. Her tenure as the Queen is likely to feature several royal crises, including Prince Charless split from Diana, Princess of Wales.The award-winning show, one of the most popular on Netflix, has been described as part of the global cultural zeitgeist by Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix. The cast from season three won the Screen Actors Guild award for best ensemble in a drama series, and Colman won the Golden Globe for best actress in a drama series. The Crown has so far won 144 award nominations.Cindy Holland, the Netflix vice-president of original content, said: I fully support Peter Morgans creative decision and am excited to see how he, Imelda Staunton and the cast and crew of season five bring this landmark series to a fitting and spectacular end.',\n",

Ranjeet Bachchan, a resident of Gorakhpur district, was on a morning walk along with his cousin Aditya when a man fired at them on the pavement of the Globe Park near Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) building in Hazratganj.The lone attacker fired at Ranjeets face killing him on the spot and walked away. Bachchans cousin was injured in the shooting at around 6:30am.Aditya is undergoing treatment at the trauma centre of King Georges Medical University (KGMU), where doctors stated that his condition is out of danger.The assailant was on foot and approached Ranjeet asking him for his cell phone to make a call. The assailant fired on Ranjeets face, killing him on the spot, assistant commissioner of police (Hazratganj circle), Abhay Mishra, said.Commissioner of police Sujeet Pandey said four policemen, including in-charge of the KD Singh Babu Stadium police outpost Sandeep Tewari, have been suspended after the killing.Forensic experts are scanning the spot. We have been scanning CCTVs and probing the case from all angles. The culprits will be behind the bars soon, Dinesh Singh, deputy commissioner of police (central Lucknow), said.Singh also said six teams have been constituted to probe the case and nab the culprits.Bachchans family has rushed to Lucknow after hearing the news. He lived with his wife in the state capitals Hussainganj area.His brother-in-law, Manoj Kumar Sharma, said Bachchan had celebrated his 40th birthday on Saturday and had also organised an event in support of CAA and NRC.Outraged supporters of Bachhan shouted slogans against the police outside his house.This is the second killing of a right-wing Hindu leader in the state capital in the last year.Kamlesh Tewari, the national president of the Hindu Samaj Party, was killed at his Khurshed Bagh residence on October 18 last year.(Copy has been corrected to say Bachchan was the president of Vishwa Hindu Mahasabha and not Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha)',\n",

       " '(Reuters) - Softbank (9984.T)-backed office sharing firm WeWork named real estate industry veteran Sandeep Mathrani as its new chief executive on Saturday.  Mathrani will join the company as the CEO from Feb. 18, 2020 and will report to Marcelo Claure, who will remain as executive chairman, the company said in a statement. Mathrani succeeds co-CEOs Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson, WeWork said. Both Gunningham and Minson will remain with the company at least through a transition period to ensure a smooth onboarding process, the company said.  The CEO search was handled by the WeWork board without an external executive search firm, according to people familiar with the matter, adding that a couple of search firms were initially considered. Mathrani will bring much-needed real estate experience to WeWork. He is the former chief executive of Brookfield Properties retail group, and prior to that he was an executive at real estate firms including Vornado Realty Trust. Brookfield declined to comment. The company announced in early December that Mathrani would depart Brookfield and that his last day of work would be Jan. 31.  WeWork began its search for a new CEO in November following the departure of co-founder Adam Neumann, who drew criticism for his erratic management style. WeWorks IPO was shelved last year and the company recorded a steep plunge in valuation, to less than $8 billion from $47 billion. The news about Mathrani was reported earlier on Saturday by The Wall Street Journal.

       " 'The Philippines has reported the first death from the coronavirus outside China, adding to fears about the spread of the virus as more countries imposed travel restrictions.The outbreak of the respiratory illness has killed 304 people in China since it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Across China, there were 2,590 new confirmed infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 14,380, Chinas National Health Commission said on Sunday. A study published on Saturday by scientists from the University of Hong Kong found that the virus may have infected as many as 75,815 people in Wuhan.The virus, which has been declared a global public health emergency, has caused at least 100 infections in more than 20 countries, with Britain, Russia and Sweden confirming their first infections over the weekend. Japan has recorded 20 cases, including those involving human-to-human transmission, while the US on Sunday reported its eighth case.Japan on Saturday confirmed an additional three cases among evacuees from Wuhan, including one, a man in his 40s, who initially tested negative, the health ministry said. The fatality in the Philippines is a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who died in a hospital in Manila. He appears to have been infected before his arrival in the Philippines.This is the first reported death outside China, Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the World Health Organisation representative to the Philippines, said. However, we need to take into mind that this is not a locally acquired case. This patient came from the epicentre of this outbreak.The Philippine department of health said the man was admitted to hospital on 25 January with a fever, cough and sore throat. He developed severe pneumonia, but in the past few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement, it said. However, his condition then deteriorated and he died within 24 hours.The man was with a Chinese woman who also tested positive for the virus, health secretary Francisco Duque said. She was the Philippines first case of the virus and is recovering in a hospital isolation ward.The news of the mans death was released shortly after the Philippines announced it would immediately halt the arrivals of any foreign travellers from China, joining several other countries that have imposed similar bans in an attempt to contain the virus.On Sunday, Indonesia also said it will temporarily stop flights to and from mainland China from Wednesday and bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days from entering or transiting.Stricter border controls, along with the suspension of flights and business operations have sparked fears of a slowdown in China, the worlds second-biggest economy.The US, Australia, Singapore and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China over the previous 14 days, and advised their own citizens not to travel there. Mongolia, Russia, and Nepal closed their land borders, while Papua New Guinea has banned anyone arriving from ports or airports across Asia. Other countries have imposed restrictions on people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days.We dont want to go on strike, but the government has been ignoring the demands of the frontline medical workers.Vietnam declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus epidemic on Saturday and said it would halt all flights to and from China. The government said it would also stop issuing visas for foreign visitors who had been in China in the past two weeks.On Sunday, New Zealand said it would bar entry to all foreign nationals arriving from mainland China. The ministry of foreign affairs and trade also raised its travel advice to New Zealanders for all of mainland China to Do not travel, the highest level.Confirmation of the first death outside China comes after thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted to go on strike, calling for the government to close the border with mainland China. The financial hub had 13 confirmed cases of the disease as of Saturday, with 112 patients isolated.More than 3,000 public hospital staff, including doctors and nurses, agreed to a week of phased strike action starting on Monday if the government failed to meet their demands. The virus is officially calledSars-CoV-2 and this causes the disease Covid-19. It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples  severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus can causepneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Chinas national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outsideChina, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend.There are nine cases of the virus in the UK. Four were located in Brighton, one in London. At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative. Of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.We dont yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we wont know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about400,000 deathseach year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. TheNHS advisesthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GPs surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is the worldwide spread of a disease. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHOs list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a window of opportunity to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Sarah BoseleyHealth editor andHannah DevlinIn China, cities began to implement more extreme restrictions on residents. In Huanggang  the second most affected city after Wuhan  authorities barred residents from leaving their homes. Families in the city, also in Hubei province, were to choose one person from their household to leave and buy food and other necessities. The city of Wenzhou in neighbouring Zhejiang province announced similar measures.In Huanggang, six officials were fired over poor performance in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua news agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the citys ability to treat patients remained inadequate and that there was a severe shortage of medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks.The situation across Hubei province remains severe and complicated and medical resources at county level are relatively weak, vice governor Xiao Juhua told a news conference on Sunday.Chinas military said it would send 1,400 medical personnel to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. The personnel will staff one of two new hospitals built in the past two weeks, scheduled to open on Monday.China is facing increasing global isolation as dozens of airlines suspended flights. Some countries are still trying to evacuate hundreds of their citizens. On Sunday Australia backed down on plans to charge its evacuees $1,000 to be taken to quarantine on Christmas Island, while a plane repatriating 250 French and European nationals landed at a military airbase in Istres in southern France.The Russian military will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday, domestic media reports said.In China itself, cities and villages are becoming ghost towns, with about 50 million people in Hubei province alone under lockdown and many more living under self-imposed quarantine.In Hubei, roads have been sealed off and public transport shut down, and the province extended its Lunar New Year holiday break to 13 February. However, people are leaving Hubei on foot over a bridge spanning the Yangtze river.Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report',\n",

    "a = 'Sara Ali Khan came as a guest on the latest episode of Kareena Kapoor Khans radio show What Women Want, where the two actors discussed modern relationships. During the interaction, Kareena asked Sara what qualities she would want in her man.When Sara said honesty, Kareena said that it was not the first thing she would notice in someone. Sara then said she would see if he was fun and has a sense of humour. Kareena was surprised that good looks was not on the list.Not really. Im not one of those. Im okay without that. It will probably be better because then they wouldnt be self-obsessed, which is something I cant handle, Sara said.Kareena looked at her in disbelief, so Sara added, I mean, he doesnt have to be bad-looking, but he doesnt have to be so good-looking that thats all we talk about. Like, thats something that one can avoid for sure.Sara then went on to say that she wants someone who is self-assured. I think somebody thats, more than good-looking or anything, just comfortable in their own skin. I think thats rare today. People that just own who they are are rare and very, very attractive. If you can be true to who you are, theres nothing like that, she said.Also read: Sara Ali Khan says anyone who tries to remind her of parentage is only trying to pressurise herWhen asked about the one thing that she would never compromise on in a relationship, Sara said fidelity. She said, If and when I get into a relationship, it would have to be with someone that I can proudly say is mine. When I say fidelity, I dont necessarily mean cheating on somebody or anything like that but I mean whole-heartedly being mine. Because Im a very independent girl. Im driven by my work, I have great friends, I have a solid support system, I have a good familyso I dont really need very much. If I was to go out of my way and make space for someone special in my life, it would have to be someone that Im proud of.According to reports, Sara was in a relationship with her Love Aaj Kal co-star Kartik Aaryan, whom she has admitted to having a crush on, but they have now parted ways. However, she has denied ever being in a relationship with him.Follow @htshowbiz for more'"
